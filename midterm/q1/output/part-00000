@@31779041 <p> Prior to the Government of Ghana 's decision to close all of the country 's borders and impose restrictions on public gatherings and movement in response to the Coronavirus outbreak , there was already concern about the ability of the Electoral Commission ( EC ) of Ghana to complete compilation of a new voter register in time for the December 2020 presidential and parliamentary elections . <p> The Ghana COVID-19 count stood at 566 confirmed cases and eight deaths as of Sunday , April 12 , 2020 , with the Greater Accra Region recording the highest number of cases ( 452 ) , followed by Ashanti Region ( 49 ) and Eastern Region ( 32 ) . <p> In total , there are confirmed cases in 10 out of the 16 regions of Ghana . Government is hopeful that the additional week of intensive enhanced surveillance and testing will yield more useful data to help it decide on the next course of action . <p> In Ghana , one immediate concern is how the current situation will affect the conduct of the 2020 general elections . Even assuming there is no slippage and the January 7 , 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President holds , questions remain as to what the current uncertainties mean for the EC 's election calendar . <p> What options are available to the EC and the country as the situation evolves ? What does a worst-case scenario look like and how should it be addressed ? This blog dissects these issues and examines the options available to the EC and the country . <p> When is the latest date for holding the elections ? <p> Articles 63 and 112 of the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana sets the timelines for holding presidential and parliamentary elections . Article 63(2) ( a ) requires the presidential election to take place " ... not earlier than four months nor later than a month before the term of office expires , " while , per article 112 ( 4 ) , parliamentary elections must be held ' within thirty days before the expiration of a Session of Parliament . ' <p> In essence , parliamentary elections must happen at least one month before Parliament is dissolved , which currently falls on January 6 of a new year . Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held together since 1996 , the combined effect of the applicable constitutional provisions puts the time for organizing both elections ( whether separately or concurrently ) sometime during the month of December 2020 . <p> If the presidential and parliamentary election were separated , a presidential election could theoretically be held as early as September 2020 , as this would fall within the four months to the expiration of the presidential term stipulated under Article 63 . <p> In practice , however , given the EC 's usual calendar of election-year activities and where things currently stand , it would be nearly impossible to hold this year 's elections any time earlier than the usual December 7 . The challenge for the EC is how to undertake and complete all the activities necessary to deliver free , fair and credible elections while sticking to the December 7 schedule . <p> What is the latest period a voter register can be compiled to allow for the other electoral activities to proceed ? <p> Take the compilation of a voter register . All things being equal , it should take about 86 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registration process to the final process of certifying the voter register . <p> The process of collecting the biographical and biometric data of prospected voters takes about 44 days . Unlike Election Day where the EC uses all 30,000-plus polling stations to serve voters , for voter registration , the EC clusters registration centers ( normally about five in each cluster ) , with registration officials assigned to a cluster moving from one registration center to the other during the registration period , spending about eight days at each center ( during the 2012 compilation of the voter register , EC staff spent 10 days at each center ) . <p> The EC adopts this method because it is working with a limited quantity of registration kits ( 8,000 ) for an estimated 17 to 18 million voters . <p> During the registration process , a registrant whose eligibility to be registered is challenged at the registration center has to go before the District Registration Review Committee ( DDRC ) for the complaint to be adjudicated . The DDRC normally sits for 14 days . <p> After collecting the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be exhibited for 14 days for the public to verify their details , make corrections or object to any unqualified applicant . <p> Any objections made during the exhibition has to be taken to a Magistrate for final adjudication . The EC then effects all corrections and does a final cleaning of the provisional voter register before the register is certified ( ready ) for elections . This last process takes another 14 days to complete . <p> The 86 days does not include all the other preparatory work that the EC must do to get ready for the commencement of registration . In this case , it will depend on when the new registration kits are expected to arrive in the country and how long it will take for it to be processed for deployment , tested and configured with the new software . At a demonstration at the Coconut Grove Regency Hotel in Accra in December 2019 , prospective vendors were expected to manufacture , deliver , set up and test the kits within a five-month period . The EC only awarded the contract for the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting an estimated operational date sometime in June or July 2020 at the latest . Of course , these processes can be fast tracked but it means there is little room for error . In addition , it will depend on whether or not all these processes would have to be done while COVID-19-induced restrictions are in place or even if they have been lifted , whether the fear of infection remains a national threat . <p> Following the EC 's announcement to postpone the registration date and the extension of the lockdown , it is more likely that the earliest the EC can hope to go to the field would be early or mid-May 2020 . This is based on the expectation that the first batch of kits ( 4,000 ) would arrive around this time for the registration to start . This would mean that the main part of compiling the register is likely to be completed at the end of July or early August . Again , this does not factor in the real threat of a constitutional challenge to the EC 's decision to limit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghana Card and a Passport and rejecting its own Voter Identity Card used in the 2016 elections and the just ended December 2019 District Assembly Elections . An amendment to the Public Elections ( Registration of Voters ) , 2016 ( Constitutional Instrument ( CI 91 ) currently in Parliament is expected to mature once the 21 days ' sittings of Parliament requirement is met , unless two-thirds majority of Members of Parliament ( MPs ) annul the CI before it matures . <p> In essence , May is the cutoff point . Any scenario that considers June as a start date increases significantly the risk of jeopardizing the rest of the election calendar . A May start for registration means that by September , all things being equal , nomination of aspirants can be taken . Taking nominations in September will be consistent with Regulation 4 of Public Elections Regulation , 2016 ( CI 94 ) , which stipulates that the Commission of the EC shall issue a Writ of Elections to the returning officer ( the EC Chair ) specifying when nominations will be taken and elections should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not less than thirty days or more than ninety days after the last day appointed for the nomination of candidates . " Therefore , if elections are to be held on December 7 , the earliest time to take nominations will be on September 8 , 2020 and latest by November 7 , 2020 . <p> Technically , unless the EC has certified an aspirant as a candidate for the election ( presidential and parliamentary ) they can not formally campaign . Most aspirants will not have a problem but it is a risk that is avoided by aspirants before they go and invest in campaigns . The problem is that the EC can not take nominations if the register is not certified . CI 94 , which regulates Public Elections , requires a nomination form for parliamentary elections to be witnessed by two registered voters and supported by 18 others . Presidential election nominations additional stipulations but also require , at the minimum , two registered voters in each district to witness . <p> Going by the calendar , if nominations are taken in September or even October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominations , the EC can then focus on using the last six to eight weeks to work on the balloting for positions , transfer of votes , recruitment of temporary officers , training , printing of ballot papers and registers , procuring other logistics , special voting and prepping for Election Day . A June start pushes nominations close to October and then compresses the time for everything else . This leaves no room for making mistakes and correcting them and at the same time puts enormous pressure on delivering a credible election , a situation that is likely to produce more disputation and possible litigation . <p> Implications of a late voter registration exercise within a COVID-19 context on campaigning and turnout <p> The current scenarios already compress the time for campaigning . If nominations are taken in October , we are looking at between five to six weeks of official campaigning . Apart from the logistical nightmare of crisscrossing 16 regions , the campaigns must also find time for critical public engagement and interrogation of manifestoes and policy proposals of their candidates . The strong likelihood of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing threat or fear of getting infected with COVID-19 further complicates the picture . This last risk could also produce an unusually low turnout for the registration exercise . Commencement of registration in May means that registration would be taking place at a time the COVID-19 outbreak is not likely to have been fully contained or suppressed , creating a risk or fear of infection for citizens who might want to get registered . If , under those circumstances , the EC decides to proceed with registration , causing citizens to choose between their health and their right to vote , this might give rise to a legal challenge and further set back the clock . <p> The risk of a low turnout was already a concern before COVID-19 . In the recent Round 8 Afrobarometer survey in Ghana released in October 2019 , 11% of respondents did not intend to vote in the coming elections . This the highest percentage recorded since 2008 . Similar sentiments were widely expressed in the lead-up to the failed December 2019 constitutional amendment referendum , including in middle class social media circles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contemporary Ghanaian party politics appeared to cause many voters to withdraw from the electoral process entirely . Any additional obstacles in the way of registration , such as the risk or fear of contracting COVID-19 , is likely to further depress voter interest in the exercise . An unusually low turnout can produce a voter register that is legal but not deemed credible , creating other legitimacy problems for the elections . <p> Options for the EC in a Second-Best to Worse Case Scenario <p> An optimal scenario was for the EC to start registration in April . That option is obviously off the table now , leaving only a second-best and a worst-case scenario to consider . A second-best scenario envisages the EC starting in May 2020 . The EC would be time-pressed but it can still pull it off , albeit with very little room to make mistakes and correct them in time or to deal with legal challenges . The EC could utilize the Inter Party Advisory Committee ( IPAC ) to build consensus and understanding and thus minimize the risk of litigation . Recourse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreements , notably over the decision of the EC to make a Ghana passport and the card from the uncompleted Ghana Card process the only acceptable ID for establishing citizenship . This decision , which , essentially , rejects the EC 's own officially issued voter card used in the most recent elections , including the December 2019 District Assembly Elections , is almost certain to be challenged . The EC would be well advised to reverse that decision , as it is hard to sustain . <p> The other problem with the second-best scenario arises from the COVID-19 context . To commence registration in May means that EC registration staff , both temporary and permanent staff , would have to wear appropriate protective gear , enforce strict physical ( social ) distancing rules , and post Veronica Buckets and sanitizers at each registration center . This means additional cost , most certainly unbudgeted . Encouraging and mobilizing people to come out to register is going to be doubly difficult , requiring a good deal more civic education than usual . Dealing with these unanticipated Coronavirus-related challenges will further slowdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected 44 days by an additional week at the minimum , depending on the turnout . <p> These election cycle challenges arising out of COVID-19 are , of course , not limited to Ghana . Many other countries are grappling with the same issues . The International Foundation for Electoral Systems ( IFES ) reports that as at April 3 , 2020 , a number of African countries , including Nigeria , Ethiopia , Kenya , South Africa , and Cameroon , have cancelled or postponed various elections on account of COVID-19 . A few other Election Management Bodies have braved the COVID-19 outbreak to organize election . In one such country , Mali , hand-washing basins were provided and one-meter barriers were set up between voters with election officials wearing masks and gloves . Not surprisingly , domestic election observers able to observe the Malian elections reported that these measures were followed in less than 50% of the cases . <p> In the " worst-case " scenario , registration will begin in June 2020 . In that event , the EC will have to consider seriously an alternative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a much more limited voter registration exercise , one that is likely restricted to first-time eligible voters and other first timers . With that , the EC can estimate to add about one to one and half million voters to the current register . This limited registration could take 10 to 14 days . The only stumbling block to this Plan B is that the EC would have to negotiate with STL , the former hardware and software supplier , to obtain access to the biometric template that allows the EC to access fingerprint data . As explained by the EC in its many briefings , it already has the biographical data of all the 15 million-plus voters from the 2016 to 2019 register so it will be easy to migrate that data into the new system . A limited voter registration would cut the registration process down by at least four weeks and that would position the EC in a position similar to the " second best " scenario . This has to be a real option , one that the EC must plan for . All other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The EC and all election stakeholders are in uncharted waters at the moment . Every Election Management Body and country must take those actions that fit their context and peculiar circumstances .

This issue is affecting both meat and dairy farms alike . <p> Lamb took another hit this week on the schedules while beef is largely unchanged . Venison continues its consistent slide to depths not seen for many years ; that is , since 2015 and no sign of this trend being arrested . The NZ$ has risen to around 61 US cents against the US$ is not helping schedule prices . The only glimmer ahead for deer farmers is the likelihood that velvet is going to be in big demand as Asia hunts out traditional medicines to maintain good health . <p> One of the major consequences of the elimination of the virus , especially while there is the potential of it still being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutting of the border to potential migrant agricultural workers . At the moment there are still quite a few still operating within New Zealand providing some relief , however , their time will be limited . Including work visas , residence visas and student visas , last year there were approaching 400,000 temporary migrant workers available in New Zealand . Obviously not all of these worked within the primary industries , but a lot did . If/when New Zealand 's unemployment lifts to around 10% as has been tentatively estimated by Treasury under one of its more positive scenarios , this will leave about 250,000 people unemployed - bout an additional 140,000 on what we had in 2019 . This still leaves a 260,000 shortfall of temporary workers . <p> And let 's face it , on the evidence of the past , few of these additional unemployed are going to be looking for work on farms . <p> Some will , but not enough to make up for what has been lost . Horticulture and dairying are going to be the major sectors impacted upon but no doubt all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be affected . It is accepted that a single foreign worker does not necessarily equate to one domestic worker to replace them as often they are only working part -time or for only a portion of the year . So the match is a bit fuzzy but the short fall is obvious . <p> Perhaps the only minor piece of consolation is that many other developed nations are going to be experiencing similar situations . Germany , the USA and Australia have all expressed concern at some level of a lack of foreign workers able to assist in the work force . Until the world gets back onto its feet there does not appear to be a solution to this problem and the biggest loser are those foreign workers who rely upon these jobs to maintain both themselves and families back in their homelands . <p> The US congress has approved a $23.5 bln farm support package ( H/T Stevell ) as there is concern over there for both farmers and food production . Several beef and pork processing plants have closed due to staff illnesses and there are reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest , some of the support money is coming from the USDA 's Commodity Credit Corp ( CCC ) funding authority . This is a fund set up after the great depression to help support agriculture in times of hardship and " has been repeatedly tapped by the Trump Administration for tens of billions of dollars to compensate farmers and assist the sector due to the U.S.-China trade wars . " <p> The EU ( and UK ) is reporting to be largely self sufficient in most of its staple foods , although it still manages to import huge volumes of more exotic foods . There have been some concerns around logistics with border closures , but they look to be more of a temporary thing . For New Zealand the ( main ) concern is how much we can harvest and make from our primary products . This may prove to be a privileged position to be in . For many developing countries suffering under droughts , covid-19 and reductions of cheaper surplus food coming in from developed countries the next few years may be particularly bleak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have announced their 2019 financial results : <p> Silver Fern Farms Co-operative has reported a net profit after tax of $34.9m for the 2019 financial year .

@@84991041 <p> As with nearly all aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic , there 's still so much we do n't know about effective contact tracing . At this point , contact tracing apps have to collect a lot of information about you and share it with other organizations . That 's not conspiratorial paranoia ; collecting and sharing your information is exactly what these apps are supposed to do . The problem is , it will be hard to know exactly how these companies are storing and using that data . <p> Advertisement <p> For example , Jumbo Privacy recently found that North Dakota 's COVID-19 contact tracing app , Care19 , shares user data with Google , Foursquare , and other companies . This is in direct conflict with the app 's original privacy policy , which claimed the app would not share data without the user 's consent . Care19 Developer Proud Crowd updated its privacy statement in response to Jumbo Security 's findings , but we 'll probably see more stories like this going forward . <p> " The Care19 application user interface clearly calls out the usage of Foursquare on our ' Nearby Places ' screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our privacy policy does not currently explicitly mention this usage .

You might as well just not install them if you want to prevent any possibility of your information being shared , sold , or leaked . <p> Whatever your personal stance on installing these apps , we urge you to give any contact-tracing app you 're considering a bit of thought before you take the plunge . Do your research and see if it 's doing an effective job of balancing user privacy against the larger societal need ( at this moment , at least ) of recording where people have been so you , or others , can be better-informed about potential COVID-19 exposures . <p> Or do n't install an app at all .

It has killed more than 300 and spread to about two dozen countries although most , like the United States , have few cases . <p> " We still have a low risk to the American public , but we want to keep it at a low risk , " the National Institutes of Health 's infectious disease chief , Dr. Anthony Fauci , said Friday at a news conference where quarantines and temporary travel bans were announced . <p> Several factors about the virus itself affect how bad the outbreak might become . <p> MULTIPLYING INFECTIONS <p> Based on the first 425 confirmed cases in China , each infection led to 2.2 others on average , Chinese scientists reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine . That 's a bit more than ordinary flu but less than SARS , a genetic cousin of the new virus . <p> " It sounds and looks as if it 's going to be a very highly transmissible virus , " said Robert Webster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital who has studied many outbreaks . <p> Whether the new virus will weaken as it spreads or instead become better at it is n't known . <p> " This virus may still be learning what it can do , " Webster said . " We do n't know its full potential yet . " <p> SPREADING IN STEALTH <p> The biggest worry is sustained transmission , where one person spreads the virus to another and that person continues to pass it on . A related concern is how often people with no symptoms are infecting others . <p> On Thursday , scientists reported that a Chinese woman who was not ill at the time spread the virus to a man in Germany during a business trip there , and that he in turn infected several other coworkers before showing any symptoms . A child of one of the workers also is infected now . <p> This so-called asymptomatic transmission " puts a terrible burden on the screening process , " which has heavily relied on symptoms to detect cases and track close contacts to limit spread , Fauci said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to person or without causing symptoms , " it will spread further and perhaps for longer than we initially hoped , " said Dr. Ashish Jha , a Harvard University global health professor . <p> DEATH RATE <p> The mortality rate looks like 2% to 3% but could be much lower if many mild cases or infections with no symptoms are going undetected , Fauci said . <p> SARS proved fatal in about 10% of cases . The flu 's mortality rate is only 0.1% , yet it kills hundreds of thousands around the world each year because it infects millions , Lipsitch noted . So the size of the outbreak can matter as much as the lethality of the virus in terms of how many deaths ultimately occur , he said . <p> INCUBATION PERIOD <p> Chinese scientists estimate the average incubation period to be roughly five days , but said it could last up to two weeks . <p> Such a long potential incubation period can be a problem , Webster said . <p> " People can move away from where they contracted it and not even remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> TESTING GAPS <p> It 's still a struggle to determine who is or is not infected . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a test , but lacks enough confidence in its accuracy to make it widely available . Too little is known about possible methods -- throat or nose swabs versus blood or other samples -- and how many false alarms or missed cases each might give at any point in time . <p> " If we had an absolutely accurate test that was very sensitive and very specific , then we could just test people and say , ' OK , we 're good to go , ' " Fauci said at the news conference . " We do n't know the accuracy of this test . " <p> That leaves a key gap , Lipsitch said . <p> " Any factor that makes it harder to be sure if someone is a case or not makes control harder , " he said . <p> <p> Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter : @MMarchioneAP <p> <p> The Associated Press Health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Department of Science Education .

@@84182341 <p> The world 's major central banks are straining to tamp down threats to financial markets and the global economy created by the coronavirus pandemic , held back by limited tools and a new kind of risk from outside the financial system they are set up to manage . <p> Stocks rallied Friday , in part on signs of progress in Congress toward passing measures to support the economy . However , beneath the surface , Wall Street was under growing pressure as financial firms rushed out of complex bond market trades that pushed up long-term U.S. Treasury borrowing rates , which typically go down in a crisis . <p> In response , the Federal Reserve accelerated a program announced just a day earlier to pump funds into the financial system and stabilize the rise in long-term interest rates and other credit costs . The Fed is expected to cut short-term interest rates next week and could take other steps as part of its ramped up efforts to lift the economy . <p> The Bank of Canada cut its main policy rate by a half-percentage point Friday , while the European Central Bank sought to reassure investors and governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent unnerving signals of a limited response from Frankfurt . China 's central bank pumped roughly $80 billion into commercial banks as part of continuing efforts to ensure the stability of its financial system . Australia 's central bank also added funds to its banking system . <p> " There is every reason to be concerned that what we 're seeing on the ground with this virus and in this market , the response of global central banks might not be big enough , " said Bruce Kasman , head of economic research at J.P . Morgan . <p> The world 's central banks are trying to manage several shocks simultaneously . The most pressing problem Friday was reducing market disruptions tied to economic uncertainty . <p> Market mayhem turned from falling stock prices to bond volatility not seen since the financial crisis over a decade ago . U.S. banks , some analysts said , are constrained by postcrisis capital and liquidity regulations that limit their ability to cushion blows to the market . Hedge funds , others said , were tied up in bond trades that become highly unprofitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Fed and other central banks are responding by making sure banks are flush with funds to back loans , credit lines and trading so the economy 's problems are n't compounded by a malfunctioning financial system . The central bank said Friday it would pump $37 billion into the system by purchasing Treasury securities from banks -- nearly half of what it said Thursday it would do over months . <p> " These purchases are intended to address highly unusual disruptions in the market for Treasury securities associated with the coronavirus outbreak , " the New York Fed said . <p> While central banks have ample resources to pump money into the financial system , they are constrained in how much they can stimulate the broader economy because interest rates are already very low . Low interest rates boost economic growth by encouraging households and businesses to borrow , spend and invest , pulling forward outlays that might otherwise be put off until later . <p> In Japan and Europe , however , central bank target rates are already below zero . The Fed 's benchmark rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it cut the rate by more than 5 percentage points . It does n't have the room to do that now . <p> After the last crisis , central banks also resorted to a policy known as quantitative easing , in which they purchased bonds to push down long-term interest rates . But these rates are exceptionally low , too . In the U.S. , for instance , the yield on a 10-year Treasury note is below 1% . In Germany and Japan , the comparable yields are negative . <p> Central banks are n't unified in how they 'll proceed . <p> The Bank of Japan , for instance , is hesitant to join the Fed and other central banks in cutting interest rates because its target is already below zero , and it wants to focus on supporting companies affected by the epidemic , according to people familiar with the bank 's thinking . <p> " There is no urgent demand to take concerted action all at once , " said one person familiar with the BOJ 's thinking .

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney , who cut U.K. rates earlier this week , steps down from the job Sunday , to be succeeded by Andrew Bailey . Ms. Lagarde was France 's finance minister during the financial crisis but is new to central banking . <p> Investors were unnerved by her remarks earlier this week . At a news conference Thursday , she urged governments to take some of the burden off central banks in controlling the spreading economic crisis .

@@41667041 <p> It 's the last Davos Playbook for 2020 , and what a week it 's been . Playbook 's Rym Momtaz and Ryan Heath share their Davos takeaways below . But first , what everyone 's talking about this morning : U.S. financier George Soros ' bombshells . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> SHOTS ACROSS THE BOW : " Facebook will work to reelect U.S. President Donald Trump and Trump will protect Facebook , " said Soros in prepared remarks at a dinner Thursday night . He described Trump as " a conman and the ultimate narcissist ... whose politics are a malignant disease , " and Xi Jinping , as a " dictator . " Greta Thunberg got praise . Playbook 's Ryan Heath and Stephen Brown have more . <p> CRITICAL THINKING : Soros ' concern for the 2020 U.S. presidential election and the Western liberal order are seeing him double down on his philanthropic work : He announced he 's investing $1 billion in funding " critical thinking " via a new network of colleges in Europe , which will expand on his Central European University . It is the " most important project " of his life , as Soros put it . <p> SOROS VERBATIM : The U.S. , China and Russia are in the hands of " actual or would-be dictators , " Soros said . And also : " It is now easier to influence than to understand events . " <p> UK NOT A RULE TAKER : Sajid Javid , the only member of Boris Johnson 's Cabinet authorized to break the U.K. government ban on sipping " Champagne with billionaires " in Davos , caught up with Playbook Thursday . Drinking coffee rather than bubbly , the chancellor stuck to his guns on a tight year-end schedule for a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU , and elaborated on his comments last week that companies should get used to the idea that the U.K. will not align with the EU 's single market or customs union . " We wo n't diverge for its own sake -- but we wo n't be a rule taker , " Javid said . <p> STILL AT IT : Still in Davos , Greta Thunberg is leading another one of her regular protests at 11 a.m . <p> DRIVING NEXT WEEK : Forget Davos , it 's Alfalfa time , baby . " That 's an annual black-tie gathering where current and past players in the nation 's capital invite corporate titans to join them for a dinner and satirical roasts , " writes POLITICO 's John Harris . " The Davos-Alfalfa pairing serves as a kind of unofficial launch of what is now a yearlong season of corporate and political networking among a certain set of the world 's most influential people . " <h> DAVOS TAKEAWAYS <p> THE ROOKIE TAKE , FROM A FIRST-TIMER : Via Playbook 's Rym Momtaz ... <p> 1 . Speaking truth to power is not the brief . Between WEF Chairman Klaus Schwab 's saccharine remarks after Trump 's speech , and a CEO telling us that Greta Thunberg was needed in Davos to balance out the conversation , Playbook got the distinct impression that the WEF this year was a gathering of rich white dudes hiding behind a 17-year-old girl holding the U.S. president to account . <p> 2 . Continental Europe is a bit player . Sure , Ursula von der Leyen drew a big crowd for her inaugural Davos appearance as the European Commission president , but European Parliament chief David Sassoli was an also-ran , and German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's keynote barely registered in conversations . American and British corporations dominated , but their Continental fellows were far less visible . " It 's a cultural difference issue , " one WEF official reckoned . <p> 3 . Lack of diversity is a glaring problem . Aside from official political delegations , you 'd be hard-pressed to find a non-Western , non-male participant . And initiatives like the Female Quotient Equality Lounge , while improving the female presence , also highlight just how outside the nucleus of power ( embodied by the Congress Center ) they remain . <p> 4 . Why are we here again ? Sure , the world 's big-hitters in one place at the same time is a big deal . But this high school reunion for CEOs still feels like a relic from a different time : no audience participation , an exclusionary pecking order , and people networking , yes , but largely in their own circles . <p> THE VETERAN TAKE , FROM AN 8-TIMER : Here 's how Ryan Heath saw things ... <p> 1 . The global elite has priced in President Trump -- they now shrug rather than gasp . Most galling for the U.S. president : a 17-year-old is better at driving the day . <p> 2 . The WEF channeled nearly every conversation toward climate action and sustainability . That was made easier because going green is now profitable a lot of the time . <p> 3 . The future U.K. king is no mere ribbon-cutter : Prince Charles had more political impact here than the whole U.K. government -- and also more than former PM Theresa May , who did n't let her brutal opinion of Davos-goers being " citizens of nowhere " stop her from taking their money ( to speak at a private dinner ) . <p> 4 . Real debate and real inclusion make for better panels ; fake consensus bores . WEF will need to apply that to its official stages if it wants the Congress Center to get its mojo back in 2021 . <p> Channel the fig leaf : Also on the podcast , Stephen Brown discusses Trump and Twitter with Mary Beard , professor of classics at the University of Cambridge . She tells Stephen she was criticized on Twitter for being a token participant in Davos . But even " if you are the fig leaf , " you can " fight back , " she said . " Fig leaves do change things . " She continued : " A little bit of cynicism about Davos is definitely called for , but being too cynical I think misses the way that institutions are made to change by outsiders . " <h> BRINGING IN THE HRYVNIA <p> THE NEW NANNY STATE : Ukraine 's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pitched investors in Davos Thursday -- via video -- with an innovative offer : a government nanny of one 's own . " For those who invest more than $100 million , we will conclude a direct investment agreement with the state , based on the English law . These investors will receive a personal tutor -- a nanny -- from the government , speaking five languages and available on a 24/7 basis to take care of all your issues . " <p> Tax holiday : Zelenskiy 's second proposal is to " provide investors who privatize state-owned enterprises worth $10 million or more in the next two years with a five-year tax holiday . " <p> A threat or a promise ? " Not investing in Ukraine is akin to being George Bell who refused to buy Google for $1 million in 1999 ! So , do not miss out Ukraine , " Zelenskiy concluded . Let it rain hryvnia ! <h> IT AI N'T LOOKIN ' GOOD <p> FALLING SHORT : For all the Davos talk on climate change , corporate commitments and social pressure , the rhetoric still fell far short of the action needed , Columbia University 's Jason Bordoff tweeted . And he told Bloomberg : " Policy is nowhere near the level of rhetoric and ambition -- that was the theme last year , and it 's even more so this year . " <p> WOKING UP : The question is whether all the do-good pledges and globo-speak are actually just globo-bull . It 's not clear that corporations are ready to meet the high expectations they have set among governments and advocates alike , write Stephen Brown and John Harris . <p> HEAD-DESK MOMENT : Asked by the male moderator on a panel on gender balance how a governing coalition with five female leaders works , Finland 's 34-year-old Prime Minister Sanna Marin shot back , " It works like any other government . We do n't need a special meeting room or something . " <p> -- Which illustratesjust how far the world still is from gender parity . And it 's not just a feeling : We 're 257 years away , according to a WEF prediction . Check out POLITICO 's Women Rule podcast here for more . <p> BUT BUT BUT : Areije al Shakar , who heads the Bahrain Al Waha Fund of Funds , sees an upside from the lack of women . She told Playbook : " At least I 'm here ... Sometimes it helps because you stand out , you 're able to manoeuver because there are n't as many blue suits . The novelty comes when you 're a female that 's leading a fund-of-funds -- we 're a rarity .

" Every conversation seemed to revolve around the American leader and his signature brand of political disruption . Trump came back this year , and was greeted with a shrug . " <p> TALK OF THE TOWN ? In his closing press conference on Wednesday , Trump said everyone around Davos was talking about how well the U.S. economy was doing . That 's not exactly what Playbook has been hearing . One Eastern European white-badge-holder asks : " Did I miss something , or did Trump not mention the EU in his speech ? Was he really only talking about European cathedrals ? " <p> VOTING WITH THEIR HANDSHAKES : The U.K. may be angling for a doubly special relationship with the U.S. post Brexit , but at least two major British figures are publicly defying Trump by showing support for his teenage arch nemesis Greta Thunberg . <p> And the guv : Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also backed Thunberg in her clash with Trump , contrasting her contribution to tackling the climate emergency with the White House 's less helpful approach .

Must be the politician Lebanese protesters loathe the most , caretaker Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil , who is on a panel later this afternoon . To protestors , Bassil embodies the height of nepotism and corruption in an already crowded field of Lebanese politicians . <p> Remember me ? Bassil is the guy who bragged at last year 's WEF about giving lessons to the U.S. and U.K. about " running a country without a budget .

Big Davos day for Brazil Wednesday , with Economy Minister Paulo Guedes vaunting its " stable democracy " and " complete environment of good opportunities to investors around the world , " as the EU Ambassador to Brasilia put it .

The forced proximity in crawling peak-hour traffic has produced some fascinating chance encounters this week , improving our familiarity with subjects ranging from AI to street art and Indian politics . Favorite comments so far : " My CEO is speaking -- I have to be there ! " and " He 's not my president !

And to those crowding others at security lines , pretending not to see them -- twice in one day for Playbook as well . These people clearly did n't get the memo that at Davos , everyone with a badge is supposed to be equal . ( Of course , no badge , no care . ) <p> THE PRICE IS RIGHT : If you want to create your own lounge space in the Belvedere Hotel , you can expect to pay $3 million and up for the week . The bare minimum for a Promenade shopfront is $150,000 , excluding the cost of any renovations . <p> BY THE NUMBERS : One Belvedere Hotel corporate occupant said they 'd experienced a 20-percent drop in attendance at their events in 2020 .

If you 're a meat lover , you may want to pack your ham sandwich ( more on that a bit further down ) . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> MORE TRUMP : The U.S. president is holding a press conference . Watch here . <p> VDL TAKES THE STAGE : European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had her big Davos moment this morning , and she used it to send the message that the " geopolitical " focus for her new EU Commission means a new emphasis on hard power . " Europe needs credible military capabilities and we have set up the building blocks of a European defense mechanism -- it is complementary to NATO and it is different , " she said . <p> Playbook reality check : It 's unclear how von der Leyen plans on bringing her home country along for the NATO/defense ride : Germany ( where she was defense minister ! ) constantly refuses to flex its muscle . <p> Stepping up : " To be more assertive in the world , we know we must step up in some fields , " von der Leyen said . She acknowledged the EU had at times been caught flat-footed in responding to geo-political conflicts -- and conceded that EU countries have at times been too divided on foreign policy , particularly on the conflict in Libya . " Libya shows the cost of division and hesitation , " she said , calling last weekend 's ceasefire talks in Berlin " an important step in the right direction , " and saying the " Commission will strongly support reconciliation and reconstruction . " <p> Quotable : " It takes very little power to break a fragile balance , but the true power lies in putting the pieces back together again , " the Commission president said . <p> Message to Brexit Britain : Von der Leyen also used the opportunity to send a pointed message to the U.K. government of Boris Johnson , who instructed his ministers ( with the exception of Chancellor Sajid Javid ) to skip Davos : On the coming negotiations on the Political Declaration which will define the U.K. 's future relationship with the EU , von der Leyen said that while " shared values " will continue to unite the two , London should remember that " there is a difference whether you are a member state or not a member state where access to the single market is concerned . " <p> The money quote : " If it is the U.K. 's choice to be more distant to the EU , then there will be more distance where the single market is concerned , " VDL said . Mic drop . <p> NO JUSTICE LIKE TAX JUSTICE : In his Davos speech this morning , Spanish PM Pedro S ? nchez identified reestablishing social justice as a key challenge for Spain and Europe . " We live in prosperous societies which nevertheless have alarming levels of poverty , " he said , adding that tax avoidance is mentioned too rarely . " Let us not fool ourselves , " he continued , " there can not be social justice without tax justice . " <p> Echoing that message : Spain 's Deputy PM Nadia Calvi ? o , in an interview with CNBC . <p> GREEN PRINCE : Look out for the keynote speech from Prince Charles this afternoon at 2:40 p.m . The prince of Wales is a lifelong environmentalist , a philosophy he has put into practice throughout his Duchy of Cornwall ( which also happens to fund part of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 's lives , but we do n't expect he will touch on that today ) . <h> THAT 'S AWKWARD <p> GROWING PAINS : It 's not every day that one gets to witness an intense exchange between the head honcho of the European Commission and their White House counterpart , but that 's the beauty of Davos , is n't it ? On Tuesday , Ursula von der Leyen had her first bilateral meeting with Trump since becoming Commission president -- an important moment for the new , geopolitical European Commission . But alas , there were no EU-side journalists there to see it . <p> He said , she said : The White House accused Commission staffers of failing to send the names of the journalists they wanted in the room to the U.S. team in advance ; Team VDL said they 'd never been asked to do so . But despite the fact WEF journalists undergo multiple levels of security screening , the White House would n't budge on its protocol . <h> TAXING TECH <p> TRUMP HUDDLES WITH TECH EXECS : Donald Trump had breakfast today with business leaders and tech executives including Apple CEO Tim Cook , Microsoft boss Satya Nadella and Salesforce chief Marc Benioff . Also in attendance : White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump , Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow , and the U.S. secretaries of labor , transportation , commerce and treasury . <p> THE BACKDROP : The tech industry has a lot to celebrate after the Trump administration reached an agreement with France to pause plans for a digital services tax on U.S. giants including Facebook and Google , while the two sides and the OECD try to hammer out a longer term deal . ( The deal underscores how the industry continues to rack up major policy victories in Washington on trade , taxes and more . Bjarke Smith-Meyer has more on this . ) <p> QUOTABLE : " Trade truce is not the same as trade peace -- trade peace is what we should be aiming for , " said IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva on a panel this morning . <p> WHAT ABOUT THE BRITS ? Mnuchin was on a panel alongside U.K. Chancellor Sajid Javid this morning . Asked about Britain 's own planned digital tax , he said : " We will be having some private conversations ... and I am sure the president Trump and Boris Johnson will be talking on it as well , as the president did with President Macron . " He added ominously : " We think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature . If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies , we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies . " <p> The Saj unrattled : " We plan to go ahead with our digital services tax in April , " Javid said , adding that it would be " proportionate " and " temporary , " and " it will fall away once there is an international solution . " <p> In conclusion : " We all agree that something needs to happen and it should be done in an international way , " Mnuchin said . " This year could be that year of change . " <h> MORE TECH ( BECAUSE IN DAVOS YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH ) <p> DID MBS HACK BEZOS ? A bombshell revelation overnight from the Guardian , and it 's a Davos trifecta : Saudi Arabia ( which will host the G20 this year and is out in force in Davos ) , Big Tech and a billionaire . " The Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos had his mobile phone ' hacked ' in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had apparently been sent from the personal account of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia , " according to the Guardian . " The encrypted message from the number used by Mohammed bin Salman is believed to have included a malicious file that infiltrated the phone of the world 's richest man , according to the results of a digital forensic analysis ... Large amounts of data were exfiltrated from Bezos ' phone within hours . " Yikes . Perhaps a good conversation-starter over at the Saudi caf ? ? <p> 5G DINNER : Playbook 's Ryan Heath hosted a 5G-themed dinner Tuesday night ( under Chatham House rules ) , which generated passionate views on the way forward for the transformative technology . There 's lots of work ahead to beat a possible urban/rural divide , and to communicate that 5G is likely to be about much more than faster networks , but a way to connect all things , with big security and privacy implications . People want 5G networks built by domestic or allied manufacturers -- a way forward on their trust concerns could be the virtualization of some parts of these networks . A POLITICO-Qualcomm survey across 12 markets will be published in the coming days . <p> PROTOCOL PREVIEW : Protocol , a new media company that will exclusively cover tech from POLITICO publisher Robert Allbritton , is hosting a pre-launch VIP breakfast on Thursday at Nasdaq 's space . The event features Protocol Editor-at-Large David Pierce , who 'll be chatting with analyst Benedict Evans on his tech predictions for 2020 .

The founding members are the presidents of Botswana and Ghana and the chairman of AngloGold Ashanti . The platform 's goal is to create 1 million jobs . <p> ON LGBTI RIGHTS : " I 'm the prime minister and I 'm also gay , " Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel told Playbook . " I think if people are here , they are here because of their profession -- it 's not the gay prime minister who is going to meet with the gay CEO of Apple , but Tim Cook is going to meet Xavier Bettel , and both are gay . And that 's cool . " For more sign up to our Davos Confidential podcast . <p> LISTEN TO THE BIG D : There is much talk about diversity , and how to make the corporate world more inclusive . CEO of Solvay Ilham Kadri shared her vision with Playbook via this morning 's Davos Confidential podcast : " Diversity for us is not only gender , it 's nationalities , it 's ethnicity , background , orientation , it 's diversity of thoughts , it 's the big D and when you have it in the room , you need to listen to it . " <h> FIGHTING THE MAN ? <p> BATTLE FOR . ORG : Some of the world 's biggest NGOs gathered at 11:45 a.m. this morning at the WEF Congress Center to protest the proposed sale of the top-level . org domain to a private equity firm . They say the non-commercial part of the internet -- the digital home of NGOs , nonprofits and civil society -- must remain in the hands of a nonprofit . Internet Society owns . org and wants to sell it to create a billion-dollar endowment for itself and its mission to protect the open internet . Global internet governance body ICANN is mulling whether to intervene to stop the sale . <p> OVERHEARD : A Playbooker hears there may have been a Burning Man party in Davos last night . We 're confused -- is n't Burning Man supposed to be anti-The Man , and is n't Davos as The Man as can be ? If you were there , get in touch -- we promise not to out you . <h> DAVOS INSIDER <p> VEGGIE DAY : It 's vegetarian and **27;250;TOOLONG menu day in the Congress Hall today -- for those who have been quick and lucky enough to identify both when and where the elusive food gets served . It 's part of the WEF 's sustainability push . Ninety percent of the food served during the forum is seasonal . <p> FORGET WHAT SHE SAID : Playbook can confirm that Theresa May will be joining the " citizens of nowhere " ( as she famously described globalists ) in Davos this week , and has been booked ( for goodness knows how much cash ) to speak at a dinner PWC is hosting tonight for business people and their clients . " The earnings will be declared in the normal way , " a May aide said . As POLITICO London Playbook 's Jack Blanchard points out , the former British PM did always enjoy a good mountain walk . <p> PEAK DAVOS : Who said Davos was just about lining one 's pockets -- or growing one 's rolodex to line one 's pockets ? There were two sessions this morning to mend your tired , burned-out souls . If you had three hours to spare , the first , held atop a nearby mountain , promised to help you " learn how to add more joy to your life . " If you were pressed for time , there was a more-manageable 30-minute meditation session led by Davos regular Sadhguru . Playbook could n't get to either because we were getting in place to attend panels on geopolitics and climate policy -- no rest for the wicked . But if you are so inclined , Sadhguru is leading another morning meditation session at 8:15 a.m . Thursday morning . <p> OVERHEARD : " One of the questions on the entrance test my 10-year-old had to take was whether his father has ? 48,000 for yearly tuition . " Unclear which is more mind boggling , that a 10-year-old 's boarding school should cost this much , or that a 10-year-old should know how much his father makes . Playbook did n't ask whether there was a question about the offspring 's mother 's earnings . <p> $34,000 : Speaking of expensive offspring , that 's how much vehicles rented by the U.S. Secret Service to shuttle Ivanka Trump around Davos for two days is costing taxpayers . The total price tag for the entire presidential delegation is over $4 million , according to Quartz , twice as expensive as Donald Trump 's first visit to Davos in 2018 . Playbook spotted the first daughter walking in the Congress Hall , and very few VIPs have elicited a similar commotion . Chinese journalists armed with phone-cameras tailed her , while CNN 's Jim Acosta attempted a question about her father 's impeachment . She remained unflappably mute . <p> OH MAMA : To be fair to the Trumps , Davos is a pricey place . Playbook , for instance , had a schnitzel at the Hotel Schatzalp that cost an eye-watering 56 Swiss francs ( around ? 52 or $57 ) , with undercooked and over-cucumbered potatoes . We 've had better schnitzel for a quarter of the price in a neighborhood caf ? in Vienna . <p> BIG FASHION DOES DAVOS : It had to happen : The Vogue Nightcap at Davos House was hosted by supermodel ( and philanthropist and angel investor ) Natalia Vodianova and Conde Nast Publishing Director Vanessa Kingori . The weirdest part ? Wesley Snipes requested salsa music only during the nightcap . <p> SKI REPORT : The last snowfall was Sunday and the temperatures are climbing , but Playbook ran into some lucky early risers hitting the slopes as we made our way to the Conference Hall . Today expect a high of 6C and sunny skies . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : At Goldman Sachs , sustainability is a firmwide mandate with a focus on the interconnected themes of climate transition and inclusive growth .

Explore the firm 's newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> Welcome back to the Davos Playbook , arriving a little later than expected today , just like U.S. President Donald Trump did . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> It 's top billing day in Davos -- just in case the constant stream of landing helicopters had n't clued you in already . And the special brand of WEF schizophrenia continues today : Youth climate activists are headlining panels while the world leader who occasionally mocks them gets the opening address . And it 's not the only contradiction of this forum , but more on that further below . <p> WHAT TRUMP HAD TO SAY : The U.S. president 's long-awaited Davos speech ( so long awaited , the WEF folks had to rope in some Swiss tenors in traditional dress to sing for the grumbling crowd ) was practically a love-letter to his Chinese counterpart , Xi Jinping . " He 's for China , I 'm for the U.S. , but other than that , we love each other , " Trump said when he took to the stage , 20 minutes behind schedule . ( Playbook side note : Before you pop your corks , let 's wait for the rest of the U.S.-China trade deal to be hammered out . ) <p> Trump 's two Davos messages ... <p> 1 . Got trade nerves ? Get used to it . Trump reckons his war-strategy is on the money , describing the deals he 's been making with China , Mexico , Canada and Greenland as " a new model for the 21st century . " <p> 2 . Chill out on climate change : Addressing the Greta of it all , Trump cheerfully said : " This is not a time for pessimism , " adding that " fear and doubt is not a good process , " and calling on folks to " reject the perennial prophets of doom . " But the U.S. president did indicate he wants to protect nature -- or in his words , " the majesty of God " -- his way , by committing to joining the initiative to plant 1 trillion trees . <p> Speaking of which : Before Trump 's speech , teen climate activist Greta Thunberg kicked the day off with a reality check . " The climate and the environment are hot topics right now , " Thunberg said on a morning panel , " but pretty much nothing has been done . " ( It was such a hot ticket , a woman was overheard listening to the panel livestream while using the ladies ' room , our colleague Cristina Gonzales writes in to report . ) <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Goldman Sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it 's no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business .

Also in that meeting : European Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan and Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton . What could they possibly all be talking about ? <h> TECH CENTRAL <p> TAX TRUCE ? A European alliance is trying to get Trump on board with a joint approach for taxing digital giants . If that fails , Europe 's mountain musketeers are seeking to at least settle Trump 's current tax spat with France . Those efforts appear to be off to a good start , with French President Emmanuel Macron tweeting late Monday that he had an " excellent discussion " with Trump on the digital tax , and Trump echoing that sentiment . <p> After that pleasant exchange , reports of a truce : Macron has agreed to postpone France 's tech tax until the end of the year , Elisa Braun reports for POLITICO 's Technology , Financial Services and Trade Pros . The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump pledged to postpone retaliatory tariffs in return . French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is expected to meet with his U.S. counterpart Steve Mnuchin in Davos on Wednesday . Stay tuned for more . <p> AI 'S NOT AS SCARY AS THE BOMB : Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei tried to sound reassuring on a panel this morning ominously titled " Technology Arms Race , " ( though he asked for trouble by opening with comments about an " explosion " in artificial intelligence ) . It was touted by the Economist 's Zanny Minton Beddoes as " one of the hottest tickets in Davos " -- not to mention one of the most controversial . <p> The Huawei CEO recalled that when he was a child , " the biggest fear people had was atom bombs . But if we look at history from a distance , we see enormous benefits from atomic energy and radiation , for example in medicine . Today we see fears about artificial intelligence , but we should not exaggerate : AI is not as damaging as atom bombs . " That did n't convince fellow panelist Yuval Noah Harari , a historian from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem . " The problem with AI in comparison with atomic weapons is that the danger is not so obvious , " he responded . " Everyone knows you ca n't win a nuclear war , but people do think you can win an AI arms race . That 's dangerous . " <p> POLITICO INTERVIEW : En route to Davos , Microsoft President Brad Smith swung by POLITICO 's office in Brussels . He said his company was prepared to help Europe control where and how its data is processed , amid intensifying debate over whether data should be stored in the bloc . " The default is rapidly becoming that European data should stay in Europe and be subject to European rules . We will adapt to that , " said Smith . " The real question is what 's the model for the use of data that will insure that value of the data accrues to these countries . " <h> WALKING THE WALK ... KINDA <p> GEOGRAPHY DOES N'T LIE : Climate and sustainability may be the talk of the town , but Playbook took a stroll along the Promenade and spotted the SDG tent quite a hike away -- an afterthought ? -- from the center of the action , where companies like Google , Facebook and Philip Morris International have set up shop . Not exactly the best way to convince people that sustainable change is at the heart of the discussions . <p> AND INVITATIONS DO N'T EITHER : Was historian Rutger Bregman not invited back to the WEF this year because he offended the rich and powerful last year ? That 's his take . At the 2019 forum , Bregman called out the hypocrisy of tax-minimizing billionaires flying into Davos aboard their private jets to decry climate change and inequality . <p> TROUVEZ LES FEMMES : We grilled the WEF Monday about the slow progress of increasing women 's participation at Davos . The forum responded by pledging to double female involvement by 2030 . <p> ' DOUBTS WELCOME ' : Philip Morris International is transitioning to " delivering a smoke-free future . " If that makes you raise an eyebrow , you are not the only one . The cigarette titan has a pop-up shop on the promenade where it 's pushing its " unsmoked " concept and inviting doubters to come inside and debate . Overheard at its party last night ( where attendees were serenaded by Sheryl Crow ) : " Nicotine is n't the problem , burning it is . " <p> SLEEPING IN THE SNOW -- DAVOS STYLE : Playbook 's Ryan Heath joined campaigners seeking to end homelessness in the snow last night , bunking down in a sleeping bag with some hay bales as a wind barrier against the -- 17-degree-centigrade weather . Having enjoyed the Davos high life , Ryan wanted to experience the rough end of extreme housing , inequality and weather . His takeaway : wind is the real enemy . <p> There 's a permanent risk of being discovered and told to move , and every footfall , car light or sudden movement is liable to wake you . Leaving the sleeping camp just before 6 a.m. also presented a whole new side of Davos : the supplier class made up of e-car drivers , safety officers , food vendors and others who are all up well before dawn making the WEF work for the 0.1 percent . <p> RAINBOW WAVE : Jin Xing , one of Monday night 's Crystal Award winners , is known as the Chinese Oprah , but most interestingly she gained fame and a devoted following by detailing her journey from male army colonel to female TV personality . That prominence is n't quite matched in the rest of the program , but this year there are three official WEF sessions on LGBTQ themes , including " Free to Be ( LGBTI ) " from 9 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday at the Swiss Alpine High School Auditorium . GLAAD and the Ariadne Getty Foundation are going big on Thursday , including a dinner with Yo-Yo Ma . The goal : LGBTQ advocates want to send the message that WEF 's biggest partners want these issues elevated up Davos ' agenda . <p> DAVOS GOGGLES ? " Davos is the place where conflicts are averted , business is started , disputes are finished " -- so said Ursula von der Leyen in her Monday address . If you are scratching your head to come up with which conflicts were averted in Davos , you are not the only one . <h> REPORTS CORNER <p> SLUGGISH GROWTH : That 's the 2020 forecast by IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva , and one big underlying culprit is none other than trade wars . " Global growth remains sluggish ... adjusting to live with the new normal of higher uncertainty read : Trump ... the underlying causes for trade tension are still with us , " she said . But it 's not just trade : " Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East " and " the dramatic impact that climate shocks can have as seen recently in Australia and parts of Africa " are also factors . <p> Side note : Is n't it interesting how Australia gets a name-check , but African countries are lumped together ? <p> OH THE HYPOCRISY : A report by Greenpeace highlights that 24 banks which regularly attend the WEF have provided $1.4 trillion of financial support for the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement set new emissions reduction goals in 2015 . More in this write-up by the Guardian . <p> A PESSIMISTIC GLOBAL ELITE -- PWC GLOBAL CEO SURVEY : CEOs worldwide recorded a record level of pessimism in this year 's PWC survey of some 1,500 chief execs in 83 countries . That 's despite the fact that only two years ago , the 2018 CEO survey recorded a level of optimism never seen before when it comes to worldwide economic growth . <p> TOUGH TIMES FOR DEMOCRACY AND CAPITALISM : According to the Edelman Trust Barometer , 56 percent of respondents to a survey across 28 countries worldwide agreed that " capitalism as it exists today does more harm than good in the world . " At Tuesday morning 's launch event , former Danish PM Helle Thorning Schmidt said " I am worried business will not do enough to support democracy . We need all the help we can get . " Microsoft president Brad Smith added : " Fix democracy first . We 'll find a way to do our business after that . " <h> DAVOS INSIDER <p> LUNCH MATTERS : Word to the wise : If you are not staying in one of the ( very few ) hotels do n't have a reservation , your chances of getting a proper warm meal are nil . Head to the nearest supermarket -- their cantines serve warm food all day . <p> BADGE HIERARCHY : This year , there are two levels of hotel badges ( and a very long line to pick them up , if you have n't already ) : " Strategic Partner Hotel Badges " -- all hotels , all days -- and " Regular , " which are for one day only . <p> GROW-HO-HO : Facebook 's own promotional magazine , Grow , is being stocked next to the Harvard Business Review , Arab News , FT and NY Times in the Belvedere Hotel lobby . Its cover is a " 50 over 50 " list of entrepreneurs ... they really have given up on the kids ! <p> RESPONSIBLE SWAG : Zurich at Promenade 84 has the usual blue beanies , plus coffee , tea and soup . New this year : For every beanie given away , Zurich will plant a tree . As of Monday night , they 'd given away 3,759 of them . <p> OTT : Some chalets are as tall as six storeys and come with teams of drivers , chefs and yoga instructors . A full-time Davos driver will set you back $10,000 for the week , if the amount one large consulting firm has paid up is any indication . Corporations are taking over not only shopfronts ( hence the dearth of lunch options ) but whole apartments above them and converting them into meeting and event spaces . Some , like Facebook , have erected temporary buildings that will disappear the week after Davos . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Over the next 10 years , Goldman Sachs will target $750 billion of financing , investing and advisory activity to nine areas that focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . Because , at Goldman Sachs , they believe sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it is no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business . As part of this push , Goldman Sachs is committed to helping clients position themselves for a future in which sustainability is core to all industries and integrated across markets -- making sustainable finance a firmwide mandate , to achieve an inclusive , low-carbon economy . Learn more about Goldman Sachs ' newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> Good day and welcome to Day 2 of POLITICO 's Davos Playbook . Today 's the soft launch ; on Tuesday , the serious business starts . Catch up on Sunday 's preview newsletter here . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> IN CASE YOU HAVE N'T NOTICED -- DAVOS IS GOING GREEN : It 's wall-to-wall sustainability this year ( private jets aside , cough cough ) . You ca n't escape climate exhortations on stage , on billboards , or even at the buffet line . Wednesday will be a meat-free day at the WEF . <p> SLUMMING IT : More photographic evidence that not everyone at Davos is living it up in the lap of luxury . Playbook is starting to wonder if there is n't some subliminal messaging going on with all these Twitter posts . <p> NOT SLALOMING IT : And even if you 've managed to get some more luxurious digs , there 's no rest up the mountain this year . Mondays at past WEFs might have included a leisurely day skiing or a late arrival for many participants , since not much happened before the official WEF opening on Monday evening . This year , agendas started filling up with a round of Sunday night welcome drinks , while this afternoon you can find side events on everything from cryptocurrencies to cannabis and CEOs . Then the Monday welcome drinks begin . <p> But Davos is not monopolizing summitry today ... <p> BRITISH PM BORIS JOHNSON IS BUSY with the inaugural U.K.-Africa Investment Summit , which will feature more than 20 of Africa 's 54 leaders , who are in London today . While that 's more than the African leadership contingent in Davos , it 's only around half the number of African leaders who turned up to Beijing and Moscow in recent months for similar summits . <p> SOME EUROPEAN POLITICS : European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will have to ponder a tempting offer : Local paper Tages-Anzeiger reports that during a bilateral meeting today , Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga will offer additional financial help for the EU 's migration and climate change policies -- in exchange for more favorable conditions when it comes to the EU-Switzerland framework agreement , which has been in the works for ages . <p> MACRON IS CHOOSING FRANCE and gathering 200 French and foreign CEOs , for the third year in a row , in Versailles . Sunday evening , Macron announced ? 4 billion in new investments from companies like MSC , Coca-Cola andAstraZeneca . JPMorgan Chase announced plans to double its staff in Paris in coming years as it relocates some of its services from London after Brexit , though the U.K. capital will remain far ahead of Paris in terms of headcount . <p> MEANWHILE , Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai is in Brussels today . He will meet with digital and competition chief Margrethe Vestager and Europe 's Green Deal Vice President Frans Timmermans . <p> Davos twofers : These CEO meets have one thing in common : They 're piggybacking on Davos , with more and more corporate and government leaders gathering in the fourth week of January . They either use Davos as the anchor for a meeting-packed Europe trip , or they use it as the hook to get people to their own events -- a kind of two-for-one deal behind the WEF 's back . <p> ' MAKE THE WORLD COOL AGAIN ' : If you see flowers and koala bears trekking through the snow en route from Landquart to Davos , do n't be alarmed ( unless you 're a climate offender ) : Climate activists dressed in costumes , holding banners that call for people to " ignore the Donalds and listen to the Gretas , " set off Sunday on the three-day , 40-kilometer ( 25 mile ) , frigid hike . <p> And they 've already left some traces along the way : You might see " NO PLANET B " in the snow on your way in today , as RTE 's Will Goodbody did . <h> THINGS TO PONDER <p> HAVE WE PEAKED ? Apparently some think we have reached the turning point on a host of the most important characteristics of the post-World War II Western world : globalization and capitalism . And as a result , we will be seeing more corporate responsibility given to stakeholders , with more concrete work to fight climate change and inequality . If it sounds a little familiar , that 's because we 've heard it before , but Playbook will keep an open mind throughout this week and look for signs of this momentous change . Bloomberg has a rundown of a few other areas in which the world has reportedly peaked . <p> THE NEW POWER-BROKERS : Most people did n't know what a CSO was several years ago ( it 's the chief security officer , for the record ) , but their rapid ascent continues . Ask around and you will soon realize they can have more power at their fingertips than CEOs , including the ability to shut down a company 's website or operations when under attack , without waiting for the CEO 's approval . Stay tuned for more over the coming days . <p> QUOTABLE : " Every company is now a tech company , it does n't matter what they sell , " says Brett Solomon , head of digital rights NGO Access Now . <p> WHY WEF IS LIKE HIGH SCHOOL : Do n't worry about fitting in , because everyone is as insecure as the next person in Davos . The truly important people feel weird because here they are just averagely important . The CEOs feel weird because officially they are below the national leaders in the pecking order , and ca n't escape that fact the way they do the other 51 weeks of the year . Ministers feel weird because no one recognizes them and they 're often separated from their minders . And everyone else feels like the plain person at Fashion Week . It 's perverted egalitarianism but it is , well , equalizing . <p> ... AND WHY EVERYONE COMES ANYWAY* : David Gelles for the New York Times writes that the forum has " become a punchline " but quotes Eurasia Group 's Ian Bremmer , saying " Six days of work at Davos is easily six months of work in other places " because of the intensity of private meetings among powerful people . <p> *Bill Gates is a notable absentee this year . " Bill 's schedule has shifted and he 's unable to attend Davos as planned , " his foundation said via email . <p> WHERE THERE 'S NO SMOKE , THERE 'S FIRE : Philip Morris , straining to pitch itself as more than a tobacco company ( an especially sensitive element in Davos , in light of the WEF 's ban on tobacco sponsorship ) , will be hosting a " Grand Opening " to rival the WEF 's official one , featuring a live performance by nine-time Grammy winner Sheryl Crow tonight at 6 p.m. at Promenade 63 . British artist Beverley Knight will close out the week with a live performance Thursday evening . <p> AUTO-SCHWAB -- AIRING TODAY : Filmmaker Marcus Vetter followed WEF founder Klaus Schwab for a whole year , and got very much behind the scenes . ARD airs the long-form documentary tonight ; here 's a link , and here 's where to find other language versions . <p> SUCCESSION ? Schwab sat down with CNBC for a rather odd , softball interview about his succession plans for WEF . Spoiler alert : He 's not planning on stepping down any time soon , he jokes about coming to the office with " more ideas than they can digest , " and he 's open to his son playing a large role after he 's gone ( Olivier Schwab is WEF 's head of business engagement . ) <p> -- Women and girls put in 12.5 billion hours of unpaid care work each and every day -- a contribution to the global economy of at least $10.8 trillion a year , which is more than three times the size of the global tech industry . <p> -- Getting the richest 1 percent to pay just 0.5 percent extra tax on their wealth over the next 10 years would equal the investment needed to create 117 million jobs in sectors such as elderly and childcare , education and health . <p> WEF 'S INAUGURAL SOCIAL MOBILITY REPORT : Top findings are that increasing social mobility , a key driver of income equality , by 10 percent would boost economic growth by nearly 5 percent over the next decade . The Top 10 countries in the Global Social Mobility Index are all European , the Top 5 all Scandinavian , while the five economies with the most to gain from boosting social mobility are China , the United States , India , Japan and Germany . Report here . <h> SWAG ALERT <p> -- Davos ' bottom feeders -- those with " hotel badges " -- have been excited to find a free one-day ski pass in their welcome kit . <p> -- Coffee wars : It 's not just Palantir and its sleek pavilion trying to swap coffee for your data this year . Facing off against the data giant are the Saudis , who are trying to woo your love and tourism interest in exchange for caffeine . Tata Consultancy is offering both coffee and tea in a literal face-off with the Saudis mid-Promenade . <p> Keep your eyes open and send your swag tips to davos@politico.eu . Last year 's best included free cashmere scarves from an American online university called WorldQuant . <h> TRUMP WATCH <p> MILESTONE : Today marks three years of Donald Trump 's U.S. presidency . His impeachment trial starts on Tuesday , along with his return ( diversion ? ) to Davos . For more on that , tune in to tomorrow 's edition . <h> APR ? S <p> I DAVOS , THEREFORE I WILL.I.AM : It seems rappers never die , they just go to Davos . The town 's perpetual celebrity will be speaking on inspiring young people and his AI company I.AM+ . <p> SKI REPORT : Today 's the coldest day of the week , so break out all your warmest gear : the high today will be -- 4C ( it 's a bitter -- 9 as Playbook hits your inboxes ) . There was a light snow dusting Sunday evening , but ski conditions are good . <p> TUNES : If any of this year 's attendees need a little encouragement on their transformational paths , David Bowie 's got some words for you . Go on , get those Changes in place . <p> SECURITY ! If you took the train up to Davos on Sunday , you probably saw groups of Swiss military coming in too . Do n't be alarmed , one young soldier told Playbook , they were just folks returning from their weekends away and deployments to secure the forum for the coming week . <p> TECH SNAFU : WEF participants were lining up round the corner for their badges at 11 p.m . Sunday night after first the registration center security scanners broke down , and then the computer network was blocked . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : At Goldman Sachs , sustainability is a firmwide mandate with a focus on the interconnected themes of climate transition and inclusive growth . The firm is committed to helping its clients position themselves for a future in which sustainability is core to all industries and integrated across markets . They will achieve this vision by doing what they do best -- invest , finance , advise , and innovate -- to drive global climate transition and inclusive growth strategies that accelerate positive change . That 's why Goldman Sachs is targeting $750 billion in sustainable finance growth themes by 2030 . Explore the firm 's newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> Good day and welcome to the 50th edition of the World Economic Forum -- and another year of POLITICO 's Davos Playbook , the essential daily guide to life on the world 's most elite mountain . <p> Here is the WEF center stage program , with notes on which sessions are livestreamed ( 224 will be online ) . <p> This month is also the centenary of the Treaty of Versailles going into effect , and entirely timely , as Great Power competition seems to be making a big comeback . Will this year 's forum help foster a regrouping of liberal democracies away from trade wars and toward more diplomatic cooperation on issues like Iran , proliferation , etc ? ( U.S. President Donald Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are expected to meet here to talk tariffs . ) And will the fires in Australia finally light a fire under the bums of the powers that be to take meaningful climate action ? <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Goldman Sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it 's no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business . That 's why sustainability has become a firmwide mandate with a focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . Learn more about the firm 's sustainable finance efforts. ** <h> TOP TOPIC -- CLIMATE CHANGE <p> GET ON THE GREEN TEAM OR GO HOME : Or that 's the stated goal at least . WEF is going all-in against climate change this year . With Australia reeling from catastrophic bushfires that have ravaged a huge chunk of its biodiversity , the theme could not be more relevant . Barely an hour will pass without a climate or broader sustainability session in the official program , never mind the extensive unofficial events and billboards that overtake the town . <p> WEF is also on its way to becoming climate activist Greta Thunberg 's amplifier-in-chief . The forum presents her ahead of Donald Trump and Angela Merkel in its list of high-profile speakers and reposts her articles , for example , including this Davos preview article in the Guardian , where Thunberg says : " Anything less than immediately ceasing these investments in the fossil fuel industry would be a betrayal of life itself . " <p> WEF 's alignment with Thunberg reflects many things , including the increasing concerns of WEF employees when it comes to the climate plans of companies and governments that WEF brings together year-round . " Heightened impatience " is how one polite Davos veteran staffer described the atmosphere to Playbook . Will peer pressure from all the discussions help CEOs and leaders put their money where their mouths are ? Stay tuned . <p> CONTEXT OUTSIDE THE SNOW GLOBE : Geopolitical crises are never too far in the background , though . There 's a highly anticipated conference on Libya underway in Berlin as this Playbook hits your inboxes . Protests over corruption and demanding more self-determination are still raging in Lebanon , Iraq and Iran . And the Iran nuclear deal standoff , with the triggering of the dispute resolution mechanism , casts an ever-longer shadow over any discussions about peace and security , even though Iran 's Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif pulled out of the forum this year . <p> Expect a more heated tone in some forum sessions this year : Some CEOs as well as WEF staffers are losing their patience . Ibrahim AlHusseini , an early Tesla and Uber investor who now heads investment firm FullCycle , told Playbook 's Ryan Heath that businesses need to be guided by " ecosystem supremacy . " His view is that while it 's progress for the U.S. Business Roundtable to join WEF in advocating stakeholder interests alongside shareholder interests , it 's not enough . <p> " Even financial winners have to breathe the air . They 'll have to drink water , " he said . " They still live in this closed sphere but there is nowhere else to go . So everything has to be factored in from now on . We have the science , we have the data . We have the proof . Technologies are ready . There is more than enough money sloshing around to fix this . There is no excuse to keep kicking the can forward . " <p> Look out for more " climate heroes " ( WEF 's words ) this week who are n't Greta . The teen category includes : Fionn Ferreira , who 's working to extract microplastics from water ; Melati Wijsen , who led a ban on plastic bags , straws and styrofoam in Bali ; and Autumn Peltier , the Anishinabek Nation 's 15-year-old chief water commissioner , in Canada . Adults include : Neel Tamhane , who leads a citizen tree-planting drive that 's put 9 billion trees in the ground in 27 cities in South Asia , and Jane Goodall , the primatologist who redefined the relationship between humans and animals <p> Half of economy dependent on nature : A new WEF analysis examining 163 industry sectors and their supply chains suggests " $44 trillion of economic value generation -- over half the world 's total GDP -- is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services and , as a result , exposed to risks from nature loss . Construction ( $4 trillion ) , agriculture ( $2.5 trillion ) and food and beverages ( $1.4 trillion ) are the three largest industries that depend most on nature . " <h> GUEST GUIDE <p> DAVOS A VICTIM OF ITS OWN SUCCESS ? With every global conference now looking and feeling like Davos ( think Halifax Security Forum , Munich Security Forum , German Marshall Fund conferences , NATO Engages , Doha Forum ) : What is Davos anymore ? Decision-makers and experts seem to travel around a conference circuit tearing their hair out over populism on big white sofas arranged in semi-circles against blue backdrops . Then there are competitors who borrow liberally from the WEF format , such as Concordia Summit . And to top it off : there 's more programming outside the Congress Center than inside it , putting pressure on the WEF business model . The WEF 's success is making it a victim of global elite hyperinflation . <p> Cherchez les femmes : Gender parity has n't reached the Davos summit yet . There are 2,800 participants from more than 118 countries , according to the WEF , and yet only 24 percent are women . Some might say that 's progress ( the WEF has been stuck at around 20 percent female participation for many years ) , but still not enough . WEF points out that this is more than the 21 percent share of ministerial posts women hold worldwide , and well above the ratio of female CEOs globally . <p> The radical new choice : Just stay home . More often than not , WEF press releases herald a record number of leaders and CEOs and ministers heading to Davos . This year the numbers are impressive -- but flat : around 280 senior public leaders , including more than 50 national leaders . For corporate denizens of Davos , quite a few among Playbook 's contacts are skipping this year 's event with a shrug . <p> A more radical choice ? A co-creator of Occupy Wall Street attending . " Rejecting Davos is easy when one has not been invited to attend , " Micah White writes . So he 's coming and committing " reputational suicide " -- it 's all very dramatic , but in a constructive way . " What I discovered is that Davos is not one thing . There are many Davoses at Davos . And it is possible to reject one or more sides of the gathering while still finding revolutionary potential in another aspect of it , " White said . We 'll have to check in with him at the end to see how many of his goals he managed to achieve . <p> WHO 'S NOT : French President Emmanuel Macron , ever the disrupter , is still staying away -- but not without having his own mini French Davos , called Choose France ( cheekily taking advantage of CEOs coming to Davos to make a stop in Paris first and discover all the ways Macron says his reforms have improved the investment environment . At least that 's the Elys ? e 's pitch ) . Macron also heads on Tuesday to Israel and the Palestinian territories . He 'll be attending the 75th commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz . <p> This year Boris Johnson has gone as far as to ban his ministers from attending -- except for Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid . The U.S. Congress delegation will be relatively small , thanks to the Democratic primary and impeachment process . <p> EU chief diplomat Josep Borrell was vocal about his non-attendance : " In Europe , everybody is rushing to Davos , but I think it is more important to be here , " Borrell said at the Raisina Dialogue on global governance in New Delhi . ( A good handful of his fellow EU commissioners are actually going to Davos . ) <p> It 's a kind of " Back to the Future " exercise , given that Klaus Schwab -- the Founder and Executive Chairman of the WEF -- has always advocated long-term sustainable capitalism ( see his original 1973 Davos Manifesto ) . And yet , it 's inescapable that in providing a platform for engagement with all manner of CEOs and controversial regimes , Davos is n't just a place of consensus and dialogue -- it 's also a platform used by those leaders for reputational airbrushing . That leads Playbook to ask : Is Davos one of the reasons we need a new type of capitalism ? <p> ' CEO disease ' : Perhaps another incentive for a new type of capitalism might be selfish ? The coterie of the world 's most powerful and wealthiest will be told this week , by Dr. Marta Ra of Paracelsus Recovery , a leading psychiatric treatment center in London , that the very traits that make exceptional senior executives -- tenacity , resilience , risk-taking -- are also linked to addiction , depression and anxiety . The clinic has identified a 500 percent increase in referrals of CEOs in the last seven years , with bipolar disorder becoming increasingly prevalent , according to the Telegraph . And the WEF is devoting several sessions this year to mental health . After all , the clinics in Davos that a century ago treated tuberculosis , as made famous in a certain Thomas Mann novel , are now treating burnout and depression . <h> DAVOS ESSENTIALS <p> CHECK YOUR RESERVATION ... if you 're booked at Hotel B ? nda : The establishment changed management in November . But the previous one had already sold rooms for WEF week , Blick newspaper reported . And many of those affected will first find out when trying to check in : " When we first came to the hotel , the servers were empty , " the new manager told the paper . " We could not find out who had already booked and paid for rooms . That 's why we could n't get in touch with the people concerned . " Seems you 're safe and will get a room if you 've made a reservation via the WEF 's own service provider . <p> Street sleeping in Davos : If Hotel B ? nda guests find themselves homeless , they wo n't be the only ones sleeping on the streets . Despite the below-freezing temperatures ( more like -15 Celsius or 0 degrees Fahrenheit ) , Homeless Entrepreneur , an NGO that campaigns to help the homeless use and gain skills to build new lives , will have its activists sleeping out on the streets starting Monday . The contrast between the private jets of the WEF set and those in their sleeping bags will be stark . Playbook 's Ryan Heath will be joining them , more in Tuesday 's Playbook . <p> Somewhere in between : Not everyone stays in hotels when attending Davos , or on the street . In fact , many stay in apartments in town or a trek away . And it 's not exactly fancy-ville . Behold WEF Managing Director Adrian Monck 's " glamorous " digs . <p> PRO TIP -- DRESS CODE : You 're spending a week on a mountain . Besides the obvious need for sensible snow shoes , make sure you wear layers and make at least one other concession to your setting . Maybe it 's a sweater , a jacket with a faux-fur-lined hood , or some statement boots . Whatever you do , do n't storm around the mountain in a suit alone . It does n't impress anyone : it makes you look like a tone-deaf first-timer . <p> SKI REPORT : It 's expected to be sunny and chilly Monday . Higher up , on the ski slopes , expect a frigid -15 Celsius . It snowed all morning Sunday , with low visibility at times . The pavements are slushy rather than icy across Davos town . <p> STUCK IN KLOSTERS ? If you 're not staying in Davos itself , you 're either VVIP and paying for privacy , or you booked late or are on a budget . Never fear : try the Chesa Grischuna , an old haunt of Hollywood stars and royals . If a 25-minute train ride schedule is n't convenient , the WEF shuttle leaves from Piz Buin and opposite the train station from 6 a.m. each morning , and runs until midnight ( 2.5 hours longer than the trains run ) . <h> ACTIVITY GUIDE <p> HOTTEST TICKETS : We 'll keep you up to date each morning , but we 're willing to bet Priyanka Chopra Jonas will have an edge in grabbing attention when she urges leaders to end extreme poverty . If you want to join her Tuesday , you can sign up for the " Reimagining the World 's Biggest Challenges " lunch ( hosted by Global Citizen and Teneo ) here . <p> THE PARTY WARS : Cloudflare saw the gap left by Google giving up on their annual Davos party and zoomed right into it last year . They were determined to win the crown of best Davos closing party from Salesforce ( many say they succeeded ) , and this year they 've co-opted Hotel Europe 's karaoke piano bar legend Barry , and set him up as the social sub-brand of Cloudflare Haus , at Promenade 37 . On Thursday night , Jason Derulo will top the Cloudflare party bill . <p> Freuds ' Davos House will once again be the nightcap venue of choice each night . The PR agency runs Sustainable Development Goals-themed programming until the bubbles and cocktails flow . The question on everyone 's lips : After bringing over five-star sushi chefs from London in 2019 , what will they do to whet appetites this year ? <p> If you ca n't make it across the river to Davos House , try Davos Cannabis House -- for market research only , of course . This important emerging market can be found at Promenade 69 . <p> TUNES : Davos veterans know there 's never a shortage of records spinning . So this year we 'll have Playbook Songs for the Day . Send us the song that 'll be playing between your ears this week . In the spirit of this year 's theme , let 's kick it off with two songs , one for the stakeholders , all of them , including the Salt of The Earth , and one for the climate -- because what is a Green Davos without snow ? Special thanks to Bruno Tertrais , deputy director of the Fondation pour la Recherche Strat ? gique , for the suggestions . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Over the next 10 years , Goldman Sachs will target $750 billion of financing , investing and advisory activity to nine areas that focus on climate transition and inclusive growth .

Safe travels back home everybody , and see you all up on the mountain again next year . If you liked what you read and heard here this week , subscribe to Florian 's Brussels Playbook and tune in to Ryan 's EU Confidential podcast for more . <p> " Foreboding about the future was a prevailing theme at this year 's Davos , sometimes even with a dash of dystopian prophecy , " according to John . " This brooding was accompanied often , in speeches and interviews , by a rueful acknowledgment that government leaders are desperately improvising -- often with bleak results -- to meet the political crises of the moment , much less the long-term technological and climatological challenges of the age . " <p> The big challenges ? " In key Western capitals , governance is failing . China is exploiting . Global temperatures are rising . Tech titans are groveling . Prospects for economic downturn are rumbling . Little wonder that , instead of triumphant optimism about the forces of globalization sometimes associated with Davos , some voices here made it sound like modern life is on a toboggan ride to hell . " Read on here . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : We are delivering a smoke-free future , but we ca n't do it alone . We ask the world 's leaders to join us in a conversation : 1.1 billion cigarette smokers deserve better options . Support the vision for a smoke-free future . Learn more here. ** <p> THURSDAY 'S PARTY WARS REPORT : Cloudflare lit up the Strip -- um , Promenade -- with Ellie Goulding , in acoustic , a bold challenge to other companies either afraid to host lavish parties in Davos these days or stuck hiring stars from past eras ( a dig at Salesforce who brought Sting to Davos , but forgot to invite Playbook , though we crossed Sting 's path at Davos House in the wee hours ) . Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince made a point of saying the company wants to highlight a new generation of leaders . Case in point : They brought two survivors of the Parkland school shooting on stage . <p> Meanwhile , Jack Ma and Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang hosted an art gallery dinner Wednesday with performers from all over China ( including Jack who did a magic show ) and Ma 's chefs from Hangzhou . Among the guests : Jordan 's Queen Rania and her son Crown Prince Hussein ; Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz ; the king and queen of Belgium ; Paul Kagame of Rwanda ; Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg ; IMF chief Christine Lagarde ; and CEOs James Quincey of Coca Cola , Carlos Brito of AB InBev , Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone and David Taylor of P&amp;G . <p> THE FACTS ABOUT FACEBOOK : Mark Zuckerberg penned a defense of his company , published in the Wall Street Journal , in which he insists users are in control of how their data is used . <h> MOUNTAIN ORACLE <p> GEORGE SOROS ATTACKS CHINA : Artificial Intelligence can do a great deal of harm to societies when in the wrong hands , the Hungarian-American philanthropist slash investor said over dinner Thursday . And by wrong , he meant Chinese . " China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest , strongest and technologically most advanced , " said Soros . " This makes Xi Jinping the most dangerous opponent of open societies . " <p> Soros , as always , had strong opinions and harsh words for the enemies of open societies , his erstwhile opponents . And , as every so often , he was the one on Thursday to encapsulate the general consensus on the biggest issue at Davos week . And yet , there was no word on Hungary , or its prime minister , Viktor Orb ? n -- perhaps , at 88 , he 's come to think there are bigger fish to fry . <p> Call to action : " Instead of letting ZTE and Huawei off lightly , the U.S. needs to crack down on them . If these companies came to dominate the 5G market , they would present an unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world . " <h> DAVOS PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW <p> HUGE THREAT , CREDIBLE ANSWERS : NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the Alliance will come up with " credible deterrence and defense " should Russia continue to breach the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces ( INF ) Treaty , the agreement that since 1988 has banned all land-based missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers . " We have asked all our military authorities , our commanders to look into different options and consequences , " Stoltenberg told Playbook in an interview in Davos Thursday , adding that NATO " will make a measured , proportionate and defensive decision . " <p> IT 'S SERIOUS ... " The INF treaty has been for 30 years the cornerstone of arms control . The treaty not only reduced the number of missiles but actually banned a whole category , " Stoltenberg said , referring to intermediate-range weapons . <p> Russia , he went on , " has developed and is deploying new missiles " that are " mobile , hard to detect , nuclear capable " and can reach European cities " with little warning time . " That also means the threshold for any use of nuclear weapons in a conflict is " reduced , " he said . <p> ... AND DANGEROUS FOR EUROPE : The collapse of the INF treaty most immediately creates grave new risks for Europe , especially because Russia already has its new missiles in place and any response by the West would likely hinge on the U.S. deploying new weapons on the Continent . Given transatlantic tensions , it 's far from clear that protecting Europe is high on U.S. President Donald Trump 's list of priorities . <p> DIPLOMACY FIRST : NATO ambassadors will meet with Russia today in a special NATO-Russia council , the main purpose of which , according to Stoltenberg , " is to discuss the INF treaty and for NATO allies to be able to call on Russia to come back into compliance of the treaty in a verifiable and transparent way . " Stoltenberg said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov will attend . <p> Reminder : Russia insists its new missile is not in breach of the obligations stemming from the treaty . The U.S. , dismissing those claims , has threatened to pull out of the treaty starting February 2 if Russia does not back down . <p> The bottom line : NATO has to prepare for " a world without the INF treaty , " according to Stoltenberg . Playbook 's translation : At the moment , there 's still no Plan B. <h> BREXIT ENTERTAINMENT <p> AKK ON FIRST FOREIGN MISSION : Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer , the new leader of Germany 's Christian Democratic Union , may have been in Chancellor Angela Merkel 's shadow on her trip to Davos -- and was not to be found on the official program -- but , well , Merkel did leave her a few issues to tackle , including Brexit . <p> " It is not clear what the U.K. wants , " Kramp-Karrenbauer told Bloomberg . " Once we have Brexit , there will be a European border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and we will need to have an agreement which has some kind of backstop . " <p> VARADKAR 'S ALLEGIANCES : " Ireland has obligations to protect the single market , " Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said during a Davos panel debate . " The United Kingdom would have a responsibility to abide by World Trade Organization rules , and both the United Kingdom and Ireland would have responsibilities to honor the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process . " <p> What would happen in case of no deal ? " So I think we 'd end up in a situation whereby the EU and Ireland and the U.K. would have to come together and in order to honor our commitment to the people of Ireland that there would be no hard border , we would have to agree on full alignment on customs and regulations . " <p> Is there a Brit in the room ? The audience would have loved to hear U.K. Chancellor Philip Hammond 's view -- alas , he pulled out of the panel discussion at the last minute . <p> ' No deal wo n't work ' : In the coatroom line outside the British business lunch at Davos ' Belvedere Hotel , Ryan overheard a senior British finance executive say to another U.K. executive : " I just saw Liam Fox and I lost the plot completely . I said you 've got to get out of your fact-free fantasy world . You know no deal wo n't work . We all know no deal wo n't work . " <h> QUEER DAVOS PEEKS THROUGH <p> Given the number of participating governments that , let 's face it , have little interest in promoting LGBT rights , it 's perhaps not surprising that LGBT issues have never really become part of the mainstream conversation here . <p> That 's shifted a little in recent years , thanks to organizations like Open for Business , GLAAD , HubCulture Pavilion , and the Ariadne Getty Foundation , which host unofficial events in hotels around town . But " there 's a lot more work to be done here , " said GLAAD director Sarah Kate Ellis . <p> In the spotlight : Tim Cook , the world 's most prominent openly gay CEO , joined the Davos event this year . And not without controversy . While Apple is usually invisible here , Cook chose to surface for dinner with Jair Bolsonaro , Brazil 's homophobic far-right president . <p> Where to next ? At this year 's LGBTQ lunch panel , the focus was " global acceptance . " " It 's about how we treat each other , " said Jim Fetterling , CEO of Dow . " It 's about staying the room " not simply protesting problem laws , leaders and company policies , he said . <p> Did you know ? Deutsche Bank has a self-described " head gay . " <h> THE GOOD LIFE <p> REVELATION OF 2019 : Brown is the new white . Some of the cooler ( or more unusual -- shout out to you , hat girl ) people , events and parties take place beyond the official WEF space and its supposedly status-conferring white badges . To live the Davos experience these days , all you need is brown-colored plastic -- the so-called hotel badge -- and the kind of entrepreneurialism and energy sometimes harder to find behind the security check . <p> PLAY DATE : When was the last time you played ? At the Real Play Coalition luncheon Thursday , guests played games with the CEOs of IKEA and Lego Foundation , both founding members of the Coalition , alongside Unilever and National Geographic . UNICEF also announced it will be joining the coalition as a co-chair . The group , which included private sector leaders , NGOs , philanthropists and heads of international organizations , discussed the so-called " play gap " and the significance of the erosion of playtime for children around the world . <p> FRIDAY TRADITION REVIVED : The WEF 's Farewell Party at Schatzalp , canceled for years , is now back on the agenda in the form of a mountain lunch today at 1 p.m . <p> FAVORITE QUIP : WEF 's most fashionable attendee -- British fashion designer Ozwald Boateng -- was overhead at Davos House saying he was going to " have a quick Snoop Dogg around . " <p> DAVOS ON THE DNIPRO : Kiev 's rambunctious political scene moved to the Alps . Barely two months before the Ukrainian presidential election , three of the leading candidates -- President Petro Poroshenko ; the unpopular incumbent , opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko ; and Anatoly Hrytsenko , a former defense minister -- traded potshots in separate appearances across Davos Thursday . Poroshenko compared Tymoshenko to the current Venezuelan populist strongman , and she returned the insult . Speaking to Playbook , Hrytsenko said the incumbent needed to hold on to power to stay out of jail , accusing him of corruption . The trio were here , officially , to engage with the world 's politics and business elites and build support for Ukraine , which is entering a sixth year of a hot conflict with Russia . <p> SARDINE CITY : Dutch taxpayers should be proud : The Dutch government is squeezing in up to eight staffers to a room at their hotel in the town of Klosters , itself a cheaper alternative close to Davos . <p> POLITICO PODCAST : In our final daily Davos Confidential , Ryan talks to Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra about Brexit , what worries him about the EU and why people should vote in May 's European Parliament election . Ryan also speaks to GLAAD chief Sarah Kate Ellis . Listen in here . <p> THE NEXT BIG THING : The value of electronic waste produced each year is $62 billion -- three times the value of all silver produced each year . Check out the WEF report here . Will e-waste the next big thing ? After all , Davos was key to creating momentum for the ban of single-use plastics , by now one of the EU 's cornerstone policies . Stick with us and we 'll get back to you on that . See you next year ! <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : Philip Morris International is delivering a smoke-free future .

If , on the other hand , you think Facebook has made a few mistakes that can be fixed with reforms here and there , Sandberg laid out a decent case Wednesday of how the company is changing ( without explaining how internal culture change is being implemented ) , and that Facebook does more good than bad . That Sandberg felt the need to address the idea of a government banning the tech giant 's business model and business practices , illustrates how rattled Facebook is by recent scandals . That said , Facebook and Sandberg show no sign of going anywhere . <p> SANDBERG 'S LIVE DIE ZEIT INTERVIEW : Sandberg was introduced as a role model and fighter and got a hug from her interviewer , Die Zeit 's Uwe Heuser , when the session ended . The Facebook COO moved quickly into gentle confession mode , saying the tech giant had n't " anticipated all the risks " of its monumental growth , nor " done a good job of explaining " how it handles user data . A recurring theme in Sandberg 's remarks was that the good outweighs the bad at the company , and that the current leadership is best placed to correct its own mistakes . In a move designed to re-orient Facebook to a more regulation-friendly stance , Sandberg said " we 're in a fundamental phase of rewriting the rules about tech . " <p> When Heuser asked why Instagram and WhatsApp chiefs had left the broader Facebook empire , all Sandberg could manage in reply was that she 's proud of how well the company is " sticking together " after a year of scandal . Can Mark Zuckerberg stay on as CEO/chairman supremo ? " I think he should , " she said . <p> Asked why so much data tracking is necessary , Sandberg said Facebook will roll out a " clear history " function on the site to help users minimize it . She rejected the idea of a subscription model though , because it would mean " most people ca n't afford to use it . " <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : We are delivering a smoke-free future , but we ca n't do it alone . We ask the world 's leaders to join us in a conversation : 1.1 billion cigarette smokers deserve better options . Support the vision for a smoke-free future . Learn more here. ** <p> RATING SANDBERG 'S SPEECH : out of five pandas . Sandberg took pointed questions on the chin , issued some soft mea culpas the audience wanted to hear , but successfully defended the core Facebook vision . After her remarks , and after initially leaving the stage , Sandberg bounced back up to literally lean in and strike up a conversation with a female audience member who was wearing a daring blue fur hat . The cameras went wild . It was a deft but slightly too perfect political moment . <p> SANDBERG PART II -- INSIDE HER OFF-RECORD RECEPTION FOR MEDIA : Playbook was invited but unable to attend the off-the-record session . Perhaps the most noteworthy observation from those who did attend : It mirrored the comments Sandberg had given on the record just 90 minutes earlier . <h> TODAY 'S HOT TICKETS <p> IT 'S GEORGE SOROS DAY . The billionaire slammed Facebook at his 2018 annual dinner . Who 'll be the punching bag this year ? Rumor has it he may go after China . <p> HIGH POLITICS : Anthony Scaramucci and Ehud Barak will be in conversation at 3.30 p.m. up the mountain at Canada Cannabis House . ( Israel is a huge medical cannabis center . ) <p> ALSO REST OF THE WORLD DAY : It says something about the lack of newsworthiness of many Davos speeches that we 're as excited about Soros and cannabis as the combined list of Asia , Middle East and African leaders speaking today . Still , here are the other highlights ... <p> At 5:30 p.m . President of South Africa Cyril M. Ramaphosa and President of Rwanda Paul Kagame will discuss African leadership . <p> Today the pro-LGBT forces of Davos ( generally sparse and low-key ) are gathering for lunch with GLAAD . The most interesting prominent gay Davos-goer is Apple CEO Tim Cook . The company is usually invisible here at WEF , so it 's interesting that Cook has chosen to surface this year , including for these dinner photos with Jair Bolsonaro , Brazil 's homophobic far-right president . <p> TONIGHT IS BANKERS ' NIGHT : JP Morgan ( Kirchner Museum ) and Citi ( Belvedere ) hold their receptions with their CEOs tonight , in the dinner window . Bank of America hosts its CEO nightcap at the Belvedere from 10:30 p.m . Ellie Goulding may steal the show , however , at the Cloudflare nightcap . <h> HIGHLIGHTS TOUR <p> MIRACLE ON THE MOUNTAIN : At a dinner hosted by AARP , the first six speakers were women . <p> SPOTLIGHT ON AGEING : At the AARP dinner , which looked at how to achieve more age diversity within organizations and across the workforce , someone noted there were 17 gender sessions at the WEF , but only two on age . Guests at the dinner urged a reframing of workers as " experienced " rather than old . The clear call to action : Interested organizations should work on writing the business case for hiring experienced/older workers . <p> RAJ SHAH OF THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION : The Rockefeller Foundation and Mastercard announced a $50-million investment to accelerate the use of data science by non-profit , civic and government organizations -- the kind of " collaborative philanthropy platforms " the foundation considers its hallmark . Full details here . In a similar vein Co-Impact , a global collaborative of Rockefeller , the Gates Foundation , Skoll , Chandler and the Nilekani family that is focused on improving health , education and economic opportunity , announced $80 million in grants aimed at improving the lives of 9 million people in Africa , South Asia and Latin America . <p> " We really believe in science-based , partner-based efforts that can lift up the lives of millions . Science is how we solve problems , partners is how we get scale , " foundation chief Raj Shah told POLITICO . " That marriage of capabilities is why we get so excited about partnerships . " And that 's more needed now than ever : " Populist energy has caused people to pull back their commitments to help each other out , " -- but private philanthropy is " not a substitute for real American , global , and public leadership , " Shah said . <p> PERSPECTIVE FROM A DAVOS VETERAN : Anna Tunkel , APCO Worldwide 's head of strategic initiatives , started coming to Davos 12 years ago -- before the age of Promenade pop-ups and when daily events outside the Congress Center could be counted on two hands . She told Playbook that this year there are over 100 corporate lounges and pop-ups , and they 're looking quite representative of the changing global order . In other words , the conversation is spilling outside of the Congress Center , it 's much bigger than the WEF can control ( to its dismay ) , and the brands doing the best in their positioning tend to come from China , emerging markets and tech . This year there 's " a Chinese perspective almost on every panel : from future to consumption to trade , techno nationalism and future of global leadership , " Tunkel said . <h> SPEECHES RATED <p> ANGELA MERKEL : . The German chancellor gave the standard multilateral pep talk and said populism leads to misery . Not much charisma or surprise , but that 's very on-brand for Merkel . She went on to join a WEF-organized dinner . <p> SHINZO ABE : and a half pandas . It was all optimism and success and structural reform in the Japanese PM 's speech , despite the country 's ageing and shrinking population . What a reliable multilaterialist . The WEF almost peed its pants in excitement , proclaiming : " PM Shinzo Abe Heralds New Era for Japan as Policies Bear Fruit . " Abe ticked the gender box with " womenomics , " said he was narrowing economic gaps ( equality-ish ! ) , and now we 've got another damn catchphrase to throw in the bin in disgust : " Society 5.0 " -- one premised on borderless data . <p> CONTE , EXPLAINING HIMSELF : Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte , in his address , defended his government 's plans from presumed criticism by saying that everyone else has got it wrong . " For too many years , Italian and European politicians have got the sequencing wrong ... in the past they have asked people to make sacrifices in the name of a more sparkling future ... fearing state failure , they have asked people to tolerate market failures . Citizens are now aware that sacrifices have resulted in a much worse society , " Conte said . Italians believed the EU was the solution to their problems , Conte said , but " reality turned out to be very different instead . " And so , " everyone with a few exceptions senses that tomorrow will be worse than today . " <p> Here 's the kicker : " My government is the institutional answer to the wish of the Italian people of finding a way forward , " Conte said . <p> EUROPE 'S GOT TALENT : Davos Playbook 's Florian Eder had lunch with a very interesting high-level bunch of people ( under Chatham House rules ) Wednesday . They 're thinking hard about how to make Europe more than a self-appraised champion in privacy and data protection -- but at the same time , to make sure the next big thing in tech is European . ( Here 's an accompanying WEF report on the matter . ) The mood at lunch was upbeat , the consensus : Europe is a great place to live and work . <p> It 's a European affair : " We just need to get a few things right , " Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Siza Vieira told Playbook , citing " collaboration across countries , making sure that funding is appropriate to process that -- and in that way we 'll do another favor to Europe , making sure that every citizen around Europe has an opportunity to thrive in the new economy . " <p> Make the beauties of Europe known : " If I had to make my decision today , I would n't move to the U.S. , " said one participant , calling for the EU to make it known to masters and PhD students from India that they 're welcome on the Continent ( and to change immigration laws accordingly ) . <p> Small can be beautiful : " Europe is n't made for scale , " said another lunch-mate . But that does n't have to be a disadvantage , should the next tech wave not produce consumer-based platforms but solutions for businesses . French-American entrepreneur Hicham Sabir , who was at the lunch , said afterwards : " I think Europe 's strength is in the small and medium enterprises , it 's in the innovation position it already has . " What 's missing ? " A framework to help those companies . " <h> THE GOOD LIFE <p> PUTTING HEART INTO DAVOS : Kiwi PM Jacinda Ardern 's top message : " Be kind " to people . Elisha London , CEO of United for Global Mental Health , gave her a " Be Kind " Badge from Cynthia Germanotta , Lady Gaga 's mother and co-founder of the Born This Way Foundation . <p> MCKINSEY NEWS DESERT : Journalists were not welcome at the McKinsey party Wednesday . <p> SPOTTED : Belgium 's Queen Matilde walking the Promenade after lunch Wednesday . The Netherlands ' Queen M ? xima at Davos House , along with the Crown Prince Haakon of Norway . " House of Cards " actress Robin Wright and Bono deep in conversation in Davos House . Likewise , Britain 's former Foreign Secretary David Miliband with Former Chancellor George Osborne . Matt Damon at a Co-impact collaborative fund breakfast on United Nations sustainable development goals . <p> NO THANKS ! For Swisscom 's terrible mobile Wi-Fi routers and network . Playbook has two and they 're both useless . <p> DAVOS ' BLACK TIE ARABIAN NIGHTS PARTY REVIEW : Let 's start with the positive : It was the most diverse , large crowd Playbook has seen at seven WEFs . On the other hand , the place felt like a wooden chalet version of a sardine can . Plenty of people wore sweaters rather than black tie . The place was lit red , and many in the audience seemed to have gone with red outfits too . Queen Diambi of the Democratic Republic of Congo had to beg the crowd to shut up during her remarks . <p> ACCESS + ABILITY : Steep slopes and ice do n't make Davos the most accessible place , but the Smithsonian 's ACCESS + ABILITY exhibit is raising awareness about the benefits of universal design , even in towns like this one . From the Nike FLYEASE shoes -- designed in collaboration with a teenager with cerebral palsy -- to the " soundshirt " that enables the hearing-impaired to appreciate an orchestra . Spotted : Will.i.am modeling the soundshirt . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : Philip Morris International is delivering a smoke-free future .

Thorning-Schmidt headlined POLITICO 's cocktail party at Schatzalp last night ( see a 360-degree photo here from Twiplomacy 's Matthias L ? fkens ) , where 100 or so folk put their status-envy aside to mix across the badge classes and drink , debate and slide headfirst down the mountain . <p> GOOD MORNING from a chilly Davos . Pro Tip : Few activities will produce the pure joy of Schatzalp . We look forward to welcoming you to next year 's POLITICO Sled Run . Pics from last night here , here and here . <p> Fireworks : Our interview with Thorning-Schmidt is worth a listen -- she tears strips off Theresa May and her approach to Brexit , explains the critical value of supporting children raised in conflict and its aftermath , and says it 's time for a woman to hold one of the EU 's presidential positions . She 's also a fan of Michel Barnier , the EU Brexit negotiator , who many consider a top contender for European Commission president . It 's not hard to see the pair working well together . <h> TRENDING IN DAVOS <p> WHAT WE 'RE HEARING : It 's a fool 's game to predict a single mood or top issue across the entire WEF . But there seems to be a gap between loud public criticism of WEF participants and the event itself ( Bill Browder piles on here ) , and how those folks are behaving up the mountain . This year there 's less self-congratulatory guff and a more serious level of engagement among conference participants . The corporate speed dating of previous years is on the wane , and executives who previously did n't care about issues like refugee education or a functioning free press are actually listening to the consultancies and NGOs that insist that only leadership based on inclusion , diversity and sustainability can work in the future . The challenge : Can those leaders catch up with an increasingly angry public , and also tackle issues like tax ? <p> HAIR-RAISING MOMENTS : Did you know the crew at Kopp 's Coiffure is in action from 5:30 a.m. each morning this week , visiting hotel rooms and chalets to get the hair of the great , the good and the very , very rich ready for show ? The team expands from eight to 12 for WEF week , carting gear around in waterproof backpacks . They also have a huge new salon next to Congress Center open from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. for those who ca n't bear the thought of an early morning hotel visit . Playbook can vouch for their in-salon skill . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : We are delivering a smoke-free future , but we ca n't do it alone .

( is the rating we gave Chinese President Xi Jinping for his glorious 2017 paean to globalization , sucking up to every pore of every being in the WEF realm ) . <p> OVERHEARD : A different type of ( be ) rating , at Anthony Scaramucci 's Skybridge wine tasting event Tuesday . One prominent editor criticized the WEF for choosing forum founder Klaus Schwab to interview Bolsonaro and WEF President B ? rge Brende for U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , rather than journalists . " Blowjob " was the key word . Schwab resorted to the harshest form of criticism possible in Davos : An invitation to the audience to admire the natural beauties of Brazil . <p> THE MOOCH IS ON FIRE : Say what you will about Anthony Scaramucci 's notoriously loose mouth and flirtation with reality TV , but the Mooch knows how to be Donald Trump 's unchallenged main man in Davos , shutdown be damned . Last night 's Skybridge wine tasting was no exception : packed to the rafters , white-badge-holders galore being turned down for entry , and full of 97-point wines . The one point of backlash : the sip-sized servings . No one was there to learn to be a connoisseur ! <p> GREAT IDEA : Budweiser is to power all of Atlanta with green energy when it hosts the Super Bowl February 3 . <h> NOT TRENDING IN DAVOS <p> SAUDI MINISTER SET TO PULL OUT : He would n't be particularly welcome , but one upside to Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih 's attendance could be some actual diplomacy between him and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak -- their first face-to-face meeting since they orchestrated a new OPEC+ output agreement in Vienna in December . ( Though that conversation might further cement the idea that Davos is more welcoming to nasty governments than it should be . ) Bloomberg reports Khalid Al-Falih 's " travel plans are still in flux , so it 's still possible , albeit unlikely , he makes a flying visit to Davos on Friday . " <p> REFUNDS PLEASE ! Our Stateside colleague Daniel Lippman reports that a White House official told POLITICO the Trump administration is hard at work trying to get back the taxpayer dollars dropped on Davos hotels , before the Americans ' trip was canceled due to the U.S. government shutdown . The official said they hope to get the vast majority of the money back in the next few weeks . It 's a lot of cash : Quartz reported in December that the hotel tab for Donald Trump , a number of Cabinet members and other officials ( including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner ) had already hit about $2.9 million . <p> WHO NEEDS FEEDBACK ? ' JUST KEEP GOING : ' DHL chief Frank Appel has a message for his fellow globalizers : " Just keep going . " He told CNBC Tuesday morning that his company 's annual connectedness survey shows 2017 was globalization 's best year ever , with 2018 a close second . " Globalization is not on the retreat , it 's continued , despite all the noise . So , sometimes I say , better do n't open the newspapers , just keep going , " he said . Appel expanded on the comments on Tuesday 's POLITICO WEF panel with our Global Editor Matt Kaminski . Also on the panel : UBS ' Sabine Keller-Busse , WEF 's Richard Samans , and Lippo Group 's James Riady . <p> CATCHPHRASE CAR CRASH : Are we living in a " 5G World , " " Globalization 4.0 " or the " Fourth Industrial Revolution ? " WEF needs to decide . At this rate it 's destined to be the public-private partnership version of the European Commission : so chock-full of people who feel entitled to be heard , the message often gets lost . <p> SLOW DOWN , IT 'S ONLY A SLOWDOWN NOT A COLLAPSE : The WEF really wants you to know that slower growth does n't equal recession . The forum predicts central banks are likely to moderate monetary policy to keep economic " soft spots " from turning into sharp declines , and says it hopes the opening up of China 's market will soften the blows . " Slowing down in China is not a collapse , " noted Fang Xinghai , the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission , in Davos . Economic experts predict 6-percent growth in China for 2019 , which seems strong , but is often regarding as the tipping point into social chaos in China if it goes any lower . <h> TODAY 'S BUSINESS <p> EUROPE DAY -- IN SAFE WATERS AGAIN : It 's Europe Day in Davos , with leaders of three out of the five biggest economies speaking today . German Chancellor Angela Merkel gets the special 45-minute treatment ( plus her session is chaired by WEF founder Klaus Schwab ) . Italy 's Giuseppe Conte and Spain 's Pedro S ? nchez follow later in the afternoon , with half an hour each . <p> European self-evaluation : . " It 's a fact that in the past two years , Europe has provided much-needed ' life-support ' to the global multilateral order , and that 's despite all the internal challenges we faced , especially Brexit , " Ann Mettler told Playbook . She 's the head of EPSC , the European Commission 's in-house think tank . " I do n't know where the climate agenda would be if the COP24 had failed without our help in brokering a deal , or how much stronger protectionism would be had we not tried to counter it with an active trade policy . " Read the latest EPSC paper , pegged to the WEF . <p> HAPPENING TODAY -- EU-JAPAN DATA DOUBLE ACT : The European Commission will today certify that data transferred from the EU to Japan enjoys protection standards in line with European ones . And with that , the two can lay claim to having created the world 's largest area of data flows reciprocally considered safe . <p> Why are we telling you ? First , because unless you read Brussels Playbook ( BTW : you really should ! ) , you would n't have known about it . Second , Japan 's PM Abe , speaking in Davos today , is expected to announce that his government will take the same decision today , diplomats told us.The EU and Japan are putting yet another piece in place for the biggest trade and economic partnership agreement ever concluded by the EU , which is yet another occasion for the so-far endless series of their joint efforts to demonstrate that rule-based trade is alive and kicking . <p> ON THAT NOTE , FREE TRADE IS GREAT , SAYS LEADERLESS BRITISH DELEGATION ... on one of the most expensive billboards in Davos . Ministerial back-up will arrive today -- up to seven members of the U.K. Cabinet will be in Davos . <p> FACEBOOK WATCH : The company 's engagement ramps up today , to include a media reception and an in-demand speech session featuring COO Sheryl Sandberg and hosted by German newspaper Die Zeit . <h> TUESDAY WRAP <p> MIKE POMPEO 'S ' BEAUTIFUL COALITIONS : ' U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a boiler-plate recitation of the Trump administration 's claimed achievements and its " unleashing of animal spirits " to help the economy grow . He praised " beautiful coalitions " and repeated the claim that ISIS has been defeated . He rejected the idea that conflict with China is inevitable , but said transparency and fairness is needed from Beijing to avoid trade and other clashes . He likewise said the U.S. and Russia are not " destined to be antagonists but it will take a Russian change " to keep the peace . <p> On reforms he wants to see in NATO , the UN and EU : " I do n't have time today to go into each of them ... but it 's not about taking these institutions down , " Pompeo said . He added that " voters have tuned out politics " and are revolting around the world . " People are asking questions that have n't been asked , or have n't been taken seriously for a very long time , " Pompeo said , characterizing Donald Trump 's election as a fightback against " low expectations . " <p> Pompeo rated:Playbook gives his speech . His prepared text was n't memorable , but he talked soft and angled hard on the WEF 's weak point : That its elite audiences avoid hard questions about how they got to be so successful . <p> BRAZILIAN OFFER YOU CA N'T RESIST : Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro gave the WEF crowd another opportunity to choose between their collective sense of responsibility as citizens of everywhere and the business opportunities that a strict -- or should we say brutal -- anti-corruption agenda might bring . " Our measures will certainly provide you with incentives to do business , " said Bolsonaro , presenting the " new Brazil that we 're building " as a place open to trading with the world and to investment . His plans include pouring cash into safety and security , he said , " so you all can come visit with your families . " <p> Bolsonaro ( who strangely wore an overcoat on stage -- is that a new thing ? ) argued environmental issues " need to go hand-in-hand " with economic development , meaning " one must not emphasize one over the other , and insisted only 9 percent of Brazil 's soil was used by farmers today . <p> WHERE WERE THE WOMEN ? At Tina Brown 's annual Women of Impact dinner , hosted with Credit Suisse for the eighth time . The key speeches were from Michelle Bachelet , who was recently appointed as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and was Chile 's first female president , and Lina Khalifeh , the Jordanian founder of SheFighter , a self-defense studio . Other guests included IMF chief Christine Lagarde , Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Queen Rania of Jordan , who turned up for dessert . Brown kicked on at Davos House . <h> NEW DEAL FOR NATURE <p> WHOSE PLANET IS IT ANYWAY ? Naturalist David Attenborough has a new Netflix series to promote , which will debut at the WEF . It 's called " Our Planet " and looks spectacular , judging from a clip the audience previewed Tuesday . Not bad work for a 92-year-old icon . He offered the Davos crown an 11th commandment to observe : " Care for the natural world , and treat it with a deal of respect , " he told an admiring Duke of Cambridge , who got to interview him on stage . <p> So what 's it all about ? A " New Deal for Nature , " as a follow-up and extension of the Paris Climate Agreement . Playbook 's Florian Eder sat down for a chat with WWF International 's Director-General Marco Lambertini , whose organization is pushing for the new deal . <p> Lambertini 's challenge to WEF attendees : " This is the group of people that accounts for most of the carbon footprint today , so it goes without saying that it must be also the group of people that must start to design the solution , " he told Playbook . " And business is beginning to get it . " His evidence for that ? " In Davos , we 've been always confronting this sector . Today , we 're working together . It 's amazing that that happened only in a decade , " Lambertini said . <p> What is that new deal ? " We need to produce more food with less of everything . Less water , less land , less energy , fertilizers , less pesticides . Today , the food system is broken , is clearly not sustainable , we 're heading towards a collapse of the food system . We need to green that system , with clear targets . " <p> Lambertini says we are not doing enough on the climate , but should n't stop there anyway : " If climate is dangerous enough for business , do n't think that a collapse of the ocean of the forest system , will be less dangerous . " <p> Lambertini on Bolsonaro : Brazil 's strongman president started his term by making it easier to deforest the Amazon . " Bolsonaro is not the first , " said Lambertini . " And look what happened when Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from Paris : A wave of companies , states and mayors , stepped up and said ' we 're still in , we want to contribute even if the government does n't . ' Sometimes , these kind of radical views trigger and accelerate reaction from society , but of course they are also a concern . " <p> What would Lambertini tell Bolsonaro if he ran into him in Davos ? " I would like to say that people like Trump , Bolsonaro -- sovereignists , unilateralists , populists -- were not elected on anti-environmental agendas . The majority in America are concerned about climate change . They experience it three or four times a year now . That 's what we are trying to convey to these leaders : Do n't embrace an anti-environmental agenda , because you 're failing a large part of your electorate .

And to Jake Evans for being an all-round Davos superman . <p> DAVOS PLAYBOOK COULD N'T HAPPEN WITHOUT : Our editor Zoya Sheftalovich . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : Philip Morris International is delivering a smoke-free future . We have invested more than $4.5 billion USD in research and development to provide adult smokers with better options to continued smoking .

We are harnessing recent breakthroughs in technology to develop smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes that are much less harmful than continued smoking . But innovative products and solutions do nothing if people do n't know about them . That 's why we 're calling upon the world 's leaders to join in a global conversation .

Created by Freuds and set in a cozy , low-ceilinged golf club , Davos House instantly set itself apart from other crammed venues in town , not least because it afforded Blaine the chance to wow a crowd that included Queen Rania of Jordan and former U.K. Chancellor George Osborne with a series of stunning card illusions . <p> The takeaway : The Davos audience may be in the land of 24/7 make-believe ( where the cards are always stacked ) , but Blaine provided the first illusion that actually impressed everyone . <p> PLAN B : If you 're not on the door list at Davos House , do n't worry . Indonesia 's WIR Group is offering you the chance to test its " Location-Based Augmented Reality Game Platform " from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. today at the Indonesia Pavillon . It sounds rather like Brexit . And if you 'd rather find out what it 's like to be a tree ( yes , really ) , then visit the Tree VR exhibition inside the Congress Center . We 'd give you a preview , but the organizers said WEF had n't told them if journalists were allowed in . <p> DAVOS PRO TIP -- MAKE A DINNER EFFORT : The thing everyone hates ( but insists on having ) in Davos is an invite to a private dinner . They 're annoying because getting around Davos is complicated , but they 're also a good chance to pick apart whatever has happened on the main stage that day . Nearly every big company runs one , as do consultancies , including Brunswick and Finsbury 's tonight . <p> Playbook -- along with HuffPost 's Louise Roug -- kicked off the International Hotel Group dinner Monday at the InterContinental , where Prince William and many of the big leaders stay . It was a refreshingly grounded discussion . Listen to the first episode of our Davos Confidential podcast , featuring Roug and former Formula One driver Nico Rosberg , to find out more . What made the IHG dinner work is that everyone debated on an equal footing .

Learn more here. ** <h> EVERYTHING IS THE BEST CORNER <p> OPTIMISM IS N'T ENOUGH : One of the golden rules of Davos is to be optimistic : The forum is full of " can-do " people who , to be fair , have done many valuable things . But what Davos-goers tend to collectively recoil at is bearers of bad news , or those who doubt everything can be " win-win . " <p> If that sounds like a fundamental clash , that 's because it is . <p> How else do you explain organizations repeatedly warning about extreme inequality at the WEF , while the decision-makers who attend the forum ( and their companies ) grow markedly wealthier , some of them exponentially so , off the back of cheap debt and tax avoidance . That might be unfair but manageable if the wages and opportunities of the global middle and working classes were n't stagnating in many countries . A new worldwide UNICEF survey of 10,000 youth demonstrated staggeringly simple asks : more jobs and better education . Something 's got to give to fund those demands -- perhaps higher tax . If not , the response to exponential wealth might be exponential populism . <h> OH THE HUMANITY <p> NO MORE DAVOS MAN : " Human " is the word popping up everywhere this year . " Humans of Davos " is how the sub-30-year-old Global Shapers are framing their perspectives . Check out Hicham Sabir 's Davos diary . <p> BETTER PEOPLE : " We Are All Human " wants to harness the " unrealized potential of U.S. Hispanics , the under-appreciated heart of the American economy , " said Claudia Romo Edelman , a Swiss-Mexican diplomat who founded the organization . Another Edelman -- Margot -- is moderating " Magic at the edge of menace : How tech makes us human " from 12.30 p.m. to 1 p.m. at the Tradeshift Sanctuary . <h> TREND WATCH <p> TECH 'S TRUST PROBLEM IS NOW A CEO PROBLEM : IBM CEO Ginni Rometty is on a trust campaign this week : It 's not just lack of faith in an aspect of tech ( such as AI or data ) that 's got her worried , but trust in technology as a whole . Responsibility and transparency will be the keywords during a panel at 5.45 p.m. today called " Business Leadership in the Fourth Industrial Revolution . " Rometty 's also part of the wave of tech leaders prepared to say that " carefully targeted " government regulation is a good thing , not the devil . <p> CLIMATE CHANGE BANKRUPTCIES : The Wall Street Journal 's Russell Gold writes that California 's largest utility PG&amp;E Corp was overwhelmed by rapid climatic change as a prolonged drought dried out much of the state and decimated forests . On Monday the company , which was recently valued at $25 billion , said it planned to file for Chapter 11 protection by month 's end , citing an estimated $30 billion in liabilities and 750 lawsuits from wildfires potentially caused by its power lines . Its value has sunk to $4 billion . <p> WHAT DO CEOS THINK ? PwC asked Davos Man ( and occasional woman ) in its 22nd annual survey of the world 's bosses . Almost one in three CEOs globally said they thought economic growth will decline over the course of this year . That 's about six times as many as last year , " a record jump in pessimism , " as the annual survey of 1,300 CEOs around the world notes . " CEOs also reported a noteworthy dip in confidence in their own organizations ' revenue prospects over the short ( 12-month ) and medium ( three-year ) term . " More of them think AI will destroy more jobs than it creates . <p> Corporate oracles : The report , published Monday evening , has been a good indicator of the mood of the globe 's economic elite in the past -- and of how the real economy 's doing . The silver lining : 42 percent of the respondents still foresee an improved economic outlook ( down from 57 percent last year ) . <p> A DAVOS RECORD ? CNBC is interviewing 33 CEOs , chairmen or ministers today . That 's got to be some kind of record . Tell us if we 're wrong . <p> Playbook 's question for Publicis Groupe 's Maurice L ? vy , one of the CNBC interviewees : How much money do you make running the hotel-room system in Davos during the WEF ? <h> TODAY 'S TOP LINE-UPS <p> WHO 'S ON FIRST : Brazil 's far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro makes his d ? but on the international stage at 2:30 p.m . His speech will be the first by a global big wig at this year 's forum . Critics call Bolsonaro a homophobe , racist , a denier of climate change , among other things . But the WEF 's an inclusive place . <h> WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT DAVOS <p> Rob Cox for Reuters brands Davos " a liability in the populist era " to explain why Donald Trump , Emmanuel Macron , Theresa May , Narendra Modi and Justin Trudeau are skipping this year 's summit . But that leaves room for the leaders of Ethiopia , Vietnam and South Africa , for example . <p> David A. Andelman for CNN says Trump is smart to skip Davos , though he still ca n't distinguish between useful and expendable international events . <p> Jorge Valero for Euractiv compliments the WEF on raising tough issues but concludes : " The sense of urgency is short-lived , as fairer salaries and more inclusive societies are n't part of CEOs ' speed-dating chats or the fancy Russian parties in the Swiss resort . " <h> THE GOOD LIFE <p> OOPS ... Which hotel and restaurant sent its inflated price list to a prospective client with the file name : " SpecialWEFprices.pdf " ? <p> PRIVACY PLEASE , NO PHOTOS : Hotel Schatzalp -- the venue for tonight 's most fun appointment , for POLITICO 's own podcast-recording slash drinks slash sled-run event -- has banned staff from using smartphones during their shifts throughout the WEF week , according to a note spotted by Playbook at the hotel 's piano bar . <p> CELEB SPOTTING:Wyclef Jean will grace the Wall Street Journal party tonight , and Sting is set to appear at the Salesforce nightcap Thursday . Will.i.am , a Davos commodity these days , performed at the TIME reception Monday night . <p> MEET REAL DAVOSIANS : For the first time this year , Davos residents were invited to take part in a lottery -- with the big prize being a WEF badge . There are five lucky winners ( out of the 87 who took part ) , local paper Davoser Zeitung reported in its hard copy edition . <p> PROTEST DU JOUR : Hanging on two balconies , right around the corner from the Hotel Belvedere , a hand-written sign : " Klaus Schwab fucked up our town . " Then below it : " His friends fucked up the world . " <p> BEST MONDAY PARTY VIEW : Quartz 's welcome drinks at the Berghaus Jschalp , a gondola ride up from Davos Platz . The cashmere-y scarves , courtesy of WorldQuant , were a nice touch . <h> ICYMI <p> A DAVOS COLD SHOWER : The International Monetary Fund revised ( downwards ) its outlook for the world economy , with the expectation for expansion now 3.5 percent for 2019 and 3.6 percent for next year , 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points below October 's projections respectively . The " global expansion is weakening and at a rate that is somewhat faster than expected , " the IMF 's new chief economist , Gita Gopinath , wrote on her blog . <p> The queen of the mountain , Christine Lagarde , said at a press conference Monday that the IMF would " now announce a further downgrade of our forecast . The bottom line is , after two years of solid expansion , the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising , " especially because free trade is becoming a toxic cause and old models of multilateralism are falling apart . Expect a " serious slowdown " if policymakers do n't change course by keeping trade open , reducing public debt , shutting down tax avoidance and making sure the digital revolution is inclusive . <p> DAVID CAMERON 'S ' STUPID ' REFERENDUM : Unlike most of the British government , which is stuck at home managing the mess of Brexit , David Cameron is back in Davos . The former British PM is sticking to private events like dinners rather than the main stage , which might be just as well , given the revelations from an explosive new BBC 2 series out January 28 called " Inside Europe : 10 Years of Turmoil . " Donald Tusk tells the BBC about conversations he had with Cameron back in 2016 , in which the European Council president said he told the then-British PM to " get real " as he was trying to negotiate a deal with the EU ahead of the " stupid " Brexit referendum . " I told him bluntly , ' come on David , get real . I know that all prime ministers are promising to help you , but believe me the truth is that no one has an appetite for revolution in Europe only because of your stupid referendum . ' " <p> DAVOS GOT TALENT : INSEAD , Tata Communications and the Adecco Group 's Global Talent Competitiveness Index ( GTCI ) ranks 125 countries and 114 cities across all groups of income and levels of development . Talent is still drawn to small , high-income economies and the United States . Switzerland tops the index , followed by Singapore , the United States , Norway and Denmark <p> THE SECURITY BILL : It 's costing 9 million Swiss francs ( close to ? 8 million ) to protect the 3,000 WEF-goers . That 's 3,000 francs of security per person . Of course there are many more folks outside the secure zone who enjoy the spillover benefits ( and delays ) of the security service . The costs are shared among the Davos partners : The canton of Graub ? nden chipped in 2.25 million francs , Davos city 1.125 million , the Swiss government 3.375 million and the WEF itself 2.25 million . A true public-private partnership on costs . <p> CORRECTION : We sent you the wrong way Monday when we wrote about the latest Edelman Trust Barometer . Here 's the correct link . Main findings : " My employer " emerged as the most trusted institution followed by NGOs ( 57 percent ) , business ( 56 percent ) , government ( 48 percent ) and media ( 47 percent ) . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : Philip Morris International is delivering a smoke-free future .

@@31765541 <p> The town of Kittery has asked state officials to share the addresses of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus so first responders can be better prepared for emergency calls . <p> In a letter sent Monday to Gov . Janet Mills and Dr. Nirav Shah , director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention , Town Manager Kendra Amaral said the information is " vital to protect our public safety-first responders and our communities . " <p> It is the first known request from a Maine municipality for that information , although some other states have started to provide addresses of known COVID-19 cases to first responders at the local level . <p> Maine state law says public health information released to the public , media or other agencies may not contain potentially identifying information about the patient . The Maine CDC identifies people who have tested positive for COVID-19 only by gender , age range and their county of residence . That practice mirrors federal policy and is also followed by many , but not all , other states . <p> State health officials have said providing only county-level information protects the confidentiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they should behave as if the virus is throughout the affected counties . Kittery officials say it leaves their responders in the dark . <p> " The benefit of the policy is totally unclear ; the impact is not , " Amaral wrote . " The policy effectively withholds vital information from the first responders ( EMS , Police , Fire ) about the risk of exposure when responding to a call for public safety service . " <p> Amaral said the addresses of people with positive tests is shared with local public safety officials " on a regular basis " in New Hampshire and Massachusetts . <p> The Massachusetts commissioner of public health issued an order March 18 that allows the addresses of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to be given to local board of health and emergency response services . But that information is given " only to those who need to know in order to operate emergency response services " and can not be retained after the end of the state of emergency , the order says . <p> It was n't immediately clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The state 's Department of Health and Human Services website lists the number of cases by individual towns , but does not include addresses . <h> Related <p> Oklahoma , Alabama and South Carolina are also now sharing addresses of cornoavirus patients with local responders . South Carolina provides the information through a secure statewide database made available to first responders only . <p> Robert Long , spokesman for the Maine CDC , said the practice of listing confirmed cases only by gender , age range and county of residence is consistent with the practice in most states . <p> " This system protects patient privacy as we continue with the Department of Public Safety to ensure that first responders have the equipment and guidance they need to do their jobs safely , " Long said . <p> Long said he is not aware of requests similar to Kittery 's coming from other Maine municipalities or agencies . <p> Dispatchers from the Maine Department of Public Safety and other dispatch centers are asking virus-related questions from callers who are requesting a response to a home , whether it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCausland , spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety . <p> " Those answers help first responders know the potential of what they are dealing with , prior to arrival , " McCausland said . <h> Related <p> State health officials have repeatedly advised people to assume everyone they come into contact with could have COVID-19 and to take precautions as if they themselves have it . <p> " One of the things we know about this coronavirus is it spreads very quickly across any geography , " Shah said when asked Tuesday at a daily media briefing about why the number of positive cases is not available by town . " What we want to do is provide numbers at an aggregate enough number that gives view of what 's going on in any area , but also maintains privacy , " Shah said . <p> Sharing the information about COVID-19 patients with emergency medical responders would not mean the addresses will get shared with residents and neighbors , Amaral said . Local-level public safety staff already handle " vast amounts of private and protected information " while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned because Kittery has a limited number of first responders to handle emergencies , and ca n't afford for members to become ill when it could be avoided , she said . <p> " An undetected exposure to COVID-19 among our public safety team could have devastating effects on our ability to properly staff and support our community during this emergency , " Amaral wrote . <p> Amaral said Tuesday morning that she has not heard from Mills ' office or from the Maine CDC . <p> " Our hope is that ( Mills ) will consider the request and implement changes needed to help our public safety personnel , " she said . <p> As of Tuesday , 115 of the state 's 519 confirmed cases of the coronavirus are in York County .

@@31615041 <h> A host 's genes likely influence the spread of antibiotic resistance <p> In the gastrointestinal tract of host animals , bacteria can exchange the genes responsible for antibiotic resistance ( AR ) via small , circular chunks of DNA called plasmids . However , the process in this complex environment is n't completely understood , and AR has become a public health menace . Every year , according to the CDC , more than 2.8 million people are diagnosed with infections resistant to antibiotic treatment , and 35,000 people die . <p> " The human gut has millions of bacteria , " said microbiologist Melha Mellata , Ph.D. , at Iowa State University in Ames , Iowa . " If an AR plasmid is introduced into our gut through contaminated food or by another means , it will quickly spread to other gut bacteria , which will generate bacteria resistant to treatments with antibiotics . " To stop that from happening , she said , researchers need to know what factors trigger or reduce the transfer of plasmids . <p> This week in mSphere , an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology , Mellata and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host organism itself may play an underappreciated role in the sharing of resistance between bacteria , at least in mice . The researchers analyzed how AR-associated plasmids were transferred from one microbe to another in two genetically different groups of mice . Both groups started with the same population of gut microbes and were fed the same diet in the same environment . <p> The researchers found that the plasmids transferred successfully in some mice but not in others , which meant that AR did n't spread in the same way in all groups . That observation led the researchers to run further analyses , which suggested that the microbial transactions could be attributed to genetic factors in the mice themselves , as well as the complexity of the gut microbiota . <p> " There is something in the host 's genes that can amplify this transfer , " said Mellata , who led the study . <p> Mellata and her colleagues used a strain of Salmonella known to harbor large plasmids that make the bacterium resistant to treatment with streptomycin and tetracycline , two common antibiotics . Previous studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Escherichia coli . <p> But those previous experiments were conducted in bacterial cultures . For the new study , Mellata 's group studied how the plasmids spread to E. coli in the animals themselves . A better understanding of how resistance spreads requires examining what 's going on in the host gastrointestinal tract , she said . " We need to study this issue through the lens of the host 's complex environment , since in reality this is how this phenomenon happens . " <p> Mellata 's research at Iowa State focuses on understanding large plasmids -- which may contain many AR-related genes -- and developing vaccines for strains of E. coli that are resistant to antibiotic treatment . Previous work by her group showed that mouse strains with a limited set of known gut microbes are more susceptible to infections than conventional mice . That observation led them to investigate how the genetic background of the animal itself -- and not just the microbial community -- might have some influence on the transfer of plasmids . <p> Mellata 's group is now following up on the experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can trigger the plasmid transfer . She hopes those findings can lead to a new way to stop the spread of antibiotic resistance . " If we can target those specific host factors , we can reduce the plasmid transfer , which will prevent the emergence of new antibiotic-resistant strains , " she said . <p> " People are dying from bacterial infections , " she said . " They should not be dying from bacteria like E. coli . The emergence of bacteria resistant to last-resort antibiotics is happening really fast , and we want to discover what 's making that happen .

" during a global pandemic might seem absurd . Every day the news gets grimmer . We hear sirens outside our windows . We read stories of hospitals stretched to capacity . Loved ones are sick . We ca n't leave our homes . Finding things to be grateful for right now might seem impossible . But studies show the healing power of gratitude . Feeling and expressing thanks can improve our well-being . What 's more important during the COVID-19 pandemic than that ? <p> Spend a few minutes every day writing a list of reasons why you are grateful . For example : I am grateful for my health and for my family 's health . I am grateful for the nurses and doctors working hard to save lives . I am grateful for the love I have in my life . I am grateful the sun is shining today . I also recommend reading , listening , or watching things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neighbors in Spain and Italy making music from their balconies , and puppies exploring an aquarium . <p> If you 're feeling afraid right now , that 's okay . Anxiety can harm our emotional health , but sometimes it 's necessary , and a little bit of fear can be beneficial . Anxiety tells us that we need to be alert . And we do need to be alert right now . When we leave our homes , we need to remember to put six feet of space between other people and ourselves , not to touch our faces , and to wash our hands frequently . A little watchfulness right now is fine as long as it does n't overwhelm us . <p> We 've known for a long time about the connection between mental and physical health .

When the world feels out of control , finding order at home becomes more important . Create a schedule for yourself . You might not be able to predict what the future will bring , but you can know what will happen today if you make a routine for yourself . Wake up at the same time every morning , go to bed at the same time every night , and fill your day with activities , including work , hobbies , solo time , and family time . Keeping your home tidy can also decrease your feelings of stress . The less chaos around you , the more at peace you will feel . Write a list of the things in your home for which you are grateful . For example : I am grateful for the food in my cupboards . I am grateful for my books . I am grateful for the tree outside my window . <p> At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. have orders to stay at home . There are things to be grateful for in this situation , too . If your home includes a partner , children , or roommates , and you ca n't find as much time or space to enjoy alone time as you 'd like , people who are socially isolating solo might appear to have it easier . For those that live alone , social isolation can feel very , well , isolating . You imagine how much nicer it would be to live with family or friends right now . The grass is always greener , right ? Whatever your living situation , write a list of the things for which you feel gratitude . For example : I am grateful for my pet . I am grateful I get to spend more time with my family . I am grateful for my own space . <p> For those socially isolating solo , feelings of loneliness and disconnection can increase depression and anxiety , so carve out time in your day to connect with friends and family through FaceTime , Skype , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carve out at least one hour every day to relax alone , and remember your partner/kids/roommates need solo time , too .

Journal , write poetry , paint , draw , make a collage , play music , or try your hand at a new dish in the kitchen . Write a list of the first things you 're going to do when the stay-at-home orders are lifted . Where do you want to visit ? Who do you want to see ?

" And if there 's not a vaccine available , you are more likely to see a much larger number of cases because there is no other protection except for the social distancing measures . And so this is a very good example of why we strongly encourage the flu vaccine and other vaccines every single year to prevent disease outbreaks like this . " <p> But Bell insisted the public should not panic about COVID-19 . <p> " It 's not something to panic about , " she said . " Be rational about what to expect , so that when we see more cases , that does n't mean that this is something that is completely out of control . We 've seen it in other states .

@@71842141 <h> Read Next <p> So here we are , perfecting our social distancing skills while schools , sports and other forms of social engagement are on indefinite hold , by a dangerous virus named after a ( regal ) crown . The coronavirus is named because the centre envelope is surrounded by small protein spikes called peplomers . These little protein spikes wreak havoc when they attach to lung tissue and hijack otherwise healthy tissue into building a potentially lethal coronavirus army of invaders . <p> Because the virus settles primarily with the respiratory tract -- the nose , mouth and lungs -- it is highly contagious when people sneeze , cough or exchange respiratory droplets with others . Despite its importance , social distancing has been a social disappointment for many weekend warriors , team sport athletes , fitness fanatics and sports fans who find camaraderie , biochemical joy from dopamine rushes or stress reduction through regular exercise and sport . <p> We areboth sports scientists who study athlete health and safety . We 're also proud exercise addicts who find the prospect of not exercising almost as disturbing as the prospect of the disease itself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the flu and some practical tips on how much people should ( and should not ) exercise . <p> Look for the ' just right ' amount <p> Both too much and too little are bad while somewhere in the middle is just right . Scientists commonly refer to this statistical phenomenon as a " J-shaped " curve . Research has shown exercise can influence the body 's immune system . Exercise immunity refers to both the systemic ( whole body cellular response ) and mucosal ( mucous lining of the respiratory tract ) response to an infectious agent , which follows this J-shaped curve . <p> A large study showed that mild to moderate exercise -- performed about three times a week -- reduced the risk of dying during the Hong Kong flu outbreak in 1998 . The Hong Kong study was performed on 24,656 Chinese adults who died during this outbreak . This study showed that people who did no exercise at all or too much exercise -- over five days of exercise per week -- were at greatest risk of dying compared with people who exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously suggest that exercise up to three days per week , two to three months prior , better prepares the immune system to fight a viral infection . <p> What if we have not exercised regularly ? Will restarting an exercise routine be good or bad ? Limited data , also obtained from mice , suggests that moderate exercise for 20 to 30 minutes a day after being infected with the influenza virus improves the chances of surviving . In fact , 82% of the mice who exercised 20-30 minutes a day during the incubation period , or the time between getting infected with flu and showing symptoms , survived . In contrast , only 43% of the sedentary mice and 30% of the mice who performed strenuous exercise -- or 2.5 hours of exercise a day -- survived . <p> Therefore , at least in laboratory mice , mild to moderate exercise may also be protective after we get infected with the flu virus , whereas a little exercise is good while no exercise -- or even too much exercise -- is bad . <p> For those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much during a flu pandemic ? It is clear that both too much exercise and exercising while sick increases the risk of medical complications and dying . <p> We conducted studies on both collegiate football players and cross-country runners , which showed a decrease in secretory immunoglobulin A , or " sIgA " when athletes competed and trained hard . SIgA is an antibody protein used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens , including viruses . <p> SIgA is also closely associated with upper respiratory tract infections ( URTI ) . When sIgA levels go down , URTI 's usually go up . We saw this relationship in football players , whereas the players showed the most URTI symptoms when their sIgA levels were lowest . This indirectly suggests that over-exercise without adequate recovery may make our body more vulnerable to attack , especially by respiratory viruses . So , when it comes to immunity , our studies show that more exercise is not necessarily better . <p> How much exercise may be just right ? <p> Here are some guidelines based on just the right amount -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise ( 20-45 minutes ) , up to three times per week . <p> Strive to maintain ( not gain ) strength or fitness during the quarantine period . <p> Do avoid physical contact during exercise , such as playing team sports , that is likely to expose you to mucosal fluids or hand-to-face contact . <p> Wash and disinfect equipment after use . <p> If you use a gym , find one that is adequately ventilated and exercise away from others to avoid droplets . <p> Remain engaged with teammates through social media , rather than social gatherings or contact .

Physical distancing can mean total lockdowns and curfews , or it can mean school closures or flexible work arrangements , or closing of bars and entertainment venues , but keeping restaurants open , or variations thereof , " Leung said , speaking earlier this month . <p> " Given those three dials , you need to find your combination that is contextually acceptable but also would be able to give you health protection , economic preservation and social acceptance .

Over the next year it is anticipated it will assess the government 's response to the pandemic . <p> Daly says in his opening statement it was known early on that people in homes would be " amongst the most susceptible " . <p> Stories from overseas emerged early in the year regarding the devastating impact the virus had on older persons in residential care settings , states Daly , adding that in January NHI had begun its engagement with nursing homes to provide Covid-specific guidance . <p> In February " concerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 education and guidance for nursing homes . <p> Guidance from the Department of Health to provide dedicated guidance for residential care settings was also sought . <p> On Friday 6 March , a decision to restrict visitors to nursing homes was made , which Daly states was informed by their nursing committee , which comprises of clinical experts representing nursing homes across the country . <p> It was a decision " not taken lightly , " says Daly . <p> At the NPHET briefing of 10 March , " the decision was taken to publicly challenge the decision to restrict visitors as premature " . <p> " This is despite Hiqa , presented as the representative voice for our sector at NPHET , announcing that same day it would suspend visits by its inspectors to hospitals , citing the safety and wellbeing of people using services and staff . <p> " Two days later -- 12th March -- it cancelled inspections of all social care services . " <p> Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan has previously stressed that officials do not believe , based on the data , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed earlier this week that Hiqa received multiple allegations of outsiders entering nursing homes during the first two months of the Covid-19 outbreak despite visiting restrictions . <p> Since the beginning of the outbreak , criticisms have been made as to why action was n't taken sooner to safeguard those living in nursing homes . <p> According to Daly the first specific guidance regarding nursing home care management was only issued on 23 March , weeks into the national emergency . <p> Throughout the public health crisis , private nursing homes not under public ownership , have raised concerns about the lack of funding available for the purchase of personal protective equipment needed in nursing homes . <p> The State has since stepped in to help provide this equipment to the private sector . <p> While the Department of Health eventually intervened , Daly says key State organisations left the nursing home sector and its residents isolated in those early days . <p> " The dismay will live forever with us . " <p> A number of mistakes were made , says Daly , including the insufficient testing of residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He adds that there was also an aggressive recruitment of nursing home staff initially by the HSE . As the crisis emerged , a massive recruitment drive got underway for medical and healthcare workers to help in Irish hospitals -- but as a result there have been criticisms since that such actions decreased the level of staff working in Ireland 's nursing homes . <p> Discharging from hospitals <p> Daly will also highlight the discharging from acute hospitals to nursing homes without testing at the outset of the public health emergency in March . <p> HSE boss Paul Reid said last week that there is " no evidence whatsoever " that Covid-19 infection spread into Ireland 's nursing homes by the discharge of elderly people into nursing homes in March . <h> Related Read <p> However , Holohan said " the reality is any form of movement of people in and out of any setting increases the risk of transmission of this infection " . <p> " And if there 's movement of individuals in and out of nursing homes and longterm residential care facilities happening , that can increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee today : <p> " We were exasperated . The sector required a specific plan . We knew that Covid-19 disproportionately impacts on older people . The planning and focus was almost exclusively on our acute hospitals . " <p> While he said nursing homes had huge levels of experience in managing the outbreak of flu and norovirus every winter and have extensive experience and clinical expertise in implementing infection prevention control measures , the global pandemic was on a " different scale to any previously encountered in the sector " . <p> Daly will also tell the committee that lessons can be learned from the closer engagement brought upon by Covid-19 . <p> " There is requirement for a better and more integrated working relationship between the State and our sector . The core focus has to be on meeting the complex health and social care needs of nursing home residents , " he concludes in his statement . <p> " The whole statement points to a complete failure of the State to enact a structural plan for the nursing home sector , with the necessary financial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The document makes for very difficult reading , but it highlights many of the issues that the sector itself had raised for many weeks before the government intervened . " <p> Inspections by Hiqa <p> Also appearing before the committee today is Hiqa , the body that is legally responsible for the monitoring , inspection and registration of designated centres for older people , such as nursing homes , in Ireland . <p> Hiqa 's Chief Executive Officer , Phelim Quinn will tell the committee about the ceasing of inspections of nursing homes in March , which was also highlighted by Nursing Home Ireland . <p> " Whilst routine inspections were not initially possible , Hiqa has a process in place whereby all designated centres are formally contacted by an inspector on a regular basis to assess how they are managing in the provision of safe services to vulnerable service users , " he says in his statement . <p> He says inspections required to register new centres or to facilitate increased capacity have been expedited within days . <p> #Open journalismNo news is bad newsSupport The Journal <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are important to you <p> Hiqa has also provided information to the Department of Health and the HSE on those centres with a history of poor compliance with key regulations , as these services are at increased risk of a Covid-19 outbreak . <p> While the body is in charge of inspecting nursing homes , in 2018 it only inspected 76.4% of all 581 nursing homes . <p> Of the 581 homes , only 128 were fully compliant with the Hiqa regulations in 2018 . This issue was raised in the D ? il last week by Fine Gael 's Fergus O'Dowd , who said that the percentage of compliance was down from 27% in 2017 to 23% in 2018 . <p> Quinn will also tell the committee today that currently 80% of nursing homes are operated by private providers , despite being largely funded through the Nursing Home Support Scheme also known as the Fair Deal Scheme . <p> " The HSE did not know this sector . As a consequence , the infrastructure required by the HSE to support the private sector was under resourced and became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model of private residential care for older persons has no formal clinical governance links with the HSE , adds Quinn . <p> " Importantly , this means there is no national clinical oversight of the care being delivered to some of our most vulnerable citizens , " he says . <p> Quinn outlines that Hiqa initiated a number of interventions from 5 March , including the escalation to the HSE and the Department of Health on the risks and trends requiring a more coordinated national response . <p> On 18 March , Hiqa made a formal offer to assist the HSE in liaising with designated centres , says Quinn , stating that this was in recognition of the fact that there was no established relationship between the HSE and the private sector . <p> Sage Advocacy , a group tasked with protecting and defending the rights of vulnerable adults , older people and healthcare patients , will also tell the committee today that the impact of the outbreak on residents of nursing homes has been " frightening for many " . <p> The arrival of people in full PPE has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group 's chef executive Mervyn Taylor will tell committee members . <p> " Serious shortages of staff meant that there was little , if any , time to provide support to residents in facilities where many died .

@@31645041 <h> The lessons of West Africa 's Ebola 's crisis will save the continent from the worst of coronavirus <p> The Ebola outbreak across West Africa between 2013 and 2014 was devasting taking more than 11,000 lives in three countries . And yet , it could have been so much worse but for the heroic actions of Nigerian doctor , Ameyo Stella Adadevoh . <p> With the viral outbreak already taking hold across West Africa in Sierra Leone , Guinea and Liberia , the threat of a devastating outbreak loomed large in Nigeria -- by far the region 's largest country . And it nearly proved to be the case but for Dr. Adadevoh 's selflessness . As part of the team that diagnosed , quarantined and treated Nigeria 's first Ebola patient in Lagos , Dr. Adadevoh helped contain what could have proved a deadly outbreak in Nigeria 's densely populated commercial center . Ultimately , it came at the cost of her life . <p> " As bad as Ebola was , it was also a learning process and you can see that now . " <p> As African countries appear at risk of another viral outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now known ) , effective containment this time around will likely require more than valiant heroics . The World Health Organization and other regional and country public health experts are very worried the " fragile " health systems in most African countries will be unable to cope if coronavirus takes hold on the continent . Even China with its larger pool of technical and financial resources , appears to be struggling to contain the virus . <p> With nearly 5,000 African students studying in Hubei province where Wuhan is ground zero for the deadly virus and many more Africans living across China the continent 's risk of an outbreak is very real . <p> Yet , in dealing with a potential COVID-19 outbreak on the continent , the African countries most recently affected by a previous viral pandemic will be leaning heavily on the past to address the present . <h> The legacy of Ebola <p> More than 11,000 people died in Liberia , Guinea , and Sierra Leone alone during the 2014 Ebola outbreak . And the cost of the outbreak was also counted in economic terms with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ebola also left affected countries with increased knowledge bases of how to handle viral outbreaks . <p> " Our preparedness is based on the system we built after Ebola , " says Dr. Mosoka Fallah , acting lead of Liberia 's National Public Health Institute .

" The skill did not exist before , the knowledge did not exist before , the manpower did not exist before and the infrastructure did not exist before . " <p> The aftermath of Ebola now means West African countries including Senegal , Liberia , Sierra Leone , Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria currently rank as better prepared for COVID-19 than richer countries with more sophisticated health systems , says Gyude Moore , fellow at Center for Global Development in Washington D.C and former minister for public works in Liberia . <p> Compared to 2014 , there are already far more African countries capable of testing and diagnosing COVID-19 samples . Last week , the number of laboratories in Africa able to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nigeria and Sierra Leone joining a short list that previously only included Senegal and South Africa . For its part , Fallah says while Liberia still awaits chemical testing components for its lab , it already has the infrastructure in place to test COVID-19 samples . It 's a crucial step in preparedness given the importance of early detection and monitoring during viral outbreaks . <p> Having tested health surveillance and tracking systems is also key . Nigeria 's wider health system has also stepped up in tracking persons believed to have come in contact with any viral outbreak 's patient zero thanks to the country 's Centre for Disease Control 's ( CDC ) established network for dealing with diseases like Lassa fever , yellow fever and polio , says Dr. Mcginger Ibeneme , unit head for Lassa fever at the Nnamdi Azikwe University teaching hospital in Nnewi , southeast Nigeria . " We were able to actively trace every contact as soon it was reported , " Ibeneme says of the Ebola crisis six years ago . " There was no magic , it 's not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure for surveillance in all the Nigerian states . " <h> People power <p> While infrastructure , medication and know-how are vital in dealing with pandemics , they only remain a part of the solution . As the Ebola outbreak proved , health systems and workers will invariably also rely on getting locals to adopt simple but crucial behavioral changes , including consistent hand washing and ditching self-medication practices . <p> Given how long the process of vaccine development takes , behavior changes remain a low-hanging fruit for containing outbreaks . " If you 're going to control the spread and the transmission , behavior changes are going to be the first and probably best line of defense because it 'll take a while before we can find medical intervention , " Moore says . " By the time you are able to develop a medical counter-measure , the virus would have done significant damage . " <p> But getting the message of behavior change across to locals is not so simple given cultural or even religious nuances . <p> Amid the Ebola outbreak in Liberia , with the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process of burial rites , it took the country 's head Imam going on national radio to discuss the issue before significant change was noticed . " The government could have gone on radio as many times as we wanted but it would n't have been enough to alter people 's behavior , " says Moore , who was a government minister at the time . " It 's about finding repositories of trust and incorporating them into your incidence response system . " <p> AP Photo/Aurelie Marrier d'Unienville <p> Fighting with information . <p> Optimizing authority figures to get the message serves a double-purpose of changing social behavior and winning the public over as allies to supplement weak health systems especially where gaps in surveillance and patient tracking can worsen the outbreak , as seen in Sierra Leone . " The initial surveillance system in Sierra Leone was not enough to contain the disease and there was an escalation , " says Ibeneme who spent six months in the country as response team lead for the African Union . " That escalation made surveillance even more delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible behavior changes now better understood , especially in the countries worst affected by Ebola , chances are locals will now be far more receptive . And there 's already some early-day evidence to support that notion : " There 's more awareness and people are more proactive now , " Fallah says . " As bad as Ebola was , it was also a learning process and you can see that now . " <h> Getting set <p> Ultimately , not all African countries can reflect on direct Ebola lessons and suffering one viral outbreak does n't exactly render a country immune from another -- as DR Congo 's 10th and ongoing Ebola outbreak shows . Given close travel and trade links to China , African countries still broadly remain at risk . <p> For the best outcomes in a viral outbreak , " It 's better to over-prepare than to over-react . " <p> To ensure the best possible outcome in the event of an outbreak , African countries must prepare for the worst . " It 's better to over-prepare than to over-react , " Moore says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we knew of outbreaks that had happened in the past and , when the outbreak exceeded anything that had happened before , we were grossly unprepared .

And that 's where global bodies like the World Health Organization ( WHO ) matter . " Putting funding into this stage of preparation efforts across Africa will be the best investment at this stage , " Fallah says . For its part , WHO also has some learning to do in that regard having faced widespread criticism for its slow response to the Ebola crisis in 2014 . <p> Reuters/Francis Kokoroko <p> Officials at Accra 's international airport on alert to screen passengers in the wake of coronavirus outbreak . <p> As African countries look to learn from what worked during the Ebola crisis , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods .

" You want the community to continue to retain its trust of the authorities so you have to act in ways that promote trust not undermine it . " <p> Just like during the Ebola outbreak , countries will likely be tempted to insulate themselves as an instinctive protective measure but the chances of ending the outbreaks hinge on collaboration rather than isolation , Moore adds : " These outbreaks end if the response is collective , not individual "

He has also devoted an hour each day to what he calls " P.E . time " that he runs for his kids , hoping to keep them active and engaged .

Acting Chair of the telecoms regulator , Keabetwse Modimoeng joins CNBC Africa for more . <p> COVID-19 has , in a matter of months , infected over a million people , torn apart families and societies , and destabilised economies . The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa ( UNECA ) has revised Africa 's growth downwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely need a stimulus of $100 billion . This does not even take into consideration the pandemic 's psycho-social ramifications . <p> Unprecedented times such as these call for rapid decision-making , coupled with innovative and effective solutions that can address continually evolving challenges . In the past few weeks , several African countries have taken swift action to get ahead of this crisis by implementing a spectrum of measures , including closing borders , instituting curfews and lockdowns , providing public sanitation solutions , monitoring and treating cases , and providing relief measures for local businesses . It is evident that several African countries , which have been affected relatively later than some of their global counterparts , have learnt important lessons over the past few weeks and have applied these in their decision-making . <p> Yet , given the enormity and complexity of this problem , African countries should continue to observe and draw on regional , continental , and international best practices , while taking into account their respective local particularities . Now is the time for cross-sectoral collaborations , for top-down and bottom-up approaches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and individuals to all play their parts . <p> To supplement government efforts , mechanisms should be created to provide funding to African innovators , who are developing solutions to COVID-19 related issues . Crowdfunding platforms can be a potential solution , but only if regulators are able to fast-track requisite policies and regulations to enable them to function effectively . African professionals , such as lawyers , financial advisors and consultants , can be galvanised to donate their time to support industries and sectors that have been severely affected by this pandemic and help them implement mitigating strategies . Dalberg Advisors ' Safe Hands initiative , which is taking a multi-pronged approach encompassing inputs , manufacturers , funders , distributors , and policy to support the product and distribution of essential medical supplies at scale , serves as a case in point . Corporations should also be willing to reorient their talent pool and repurpose their facilities to address the most critical issues arising from this pandemic .

Jobs need to be retained and national government must move quickly to provide relief measures for this . Countries like Kenya and Ghana have been deploying surveys to understand the difficulties businesses are facing as a result of COVID-19 , including plunging revenues , disruptions in supply chains , inability to work remotely , and having business models that are simply untenable in the context of a global pandemic . Under such circumstances , governments can -- and several have already done so -- offer stimulus packages , including tax waivers and reductions ; lower interest rates to make debt cheaper ; provide low-interest intervention loans to vulnerable companies ; defer statutory payments for a minimum of six months without penalties ; amend policies on non-performing loans to prevent a systemic crisis among banks , and provide financial support to businesses that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter is especially important for informal sector businesses that can not implement remote working measures . <p> Good governance in times of crisis requires a combination of top-down directives and bottom-up solutions . In combating this virus , one of the challenges that African governments are facing is a lack of compliance with policy directives . In some cases , the lack of compliance is not a result of disobedience , but rather structural and systemic factors unique to African countries . For instance , preventive measures , such as social distancing , are difficult to implement in informal settlements and slums where in many cases , families of six share one 20 square meter room . Also , informal sector jobs can not be performed remotely . In light of this , extreme measures are likely to cause widespread social and humanitarian problems , as seen in places like India , where a nation-wide lockdown was instituted with a mere four hours notice . In contrast , responses by several African countries , such as Angola , Senegal , Rwanda , Ghana , and Kenya , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments can offer free basic services to vulnerable communities , including providing survival packs that can cater to daily needs and working with existing organizations -- private sector and NGOs -- who have distribution networks that are able to deliver at the last mile . African governments should lobby for debt relief , and suspension of short-term payments on sovereign bonds to free up money for more urgent needs . African countries can also take advantage of regional and continental channels to collaborate with each other and exchange information on solutions that have proven/are proving to be effective . Countries that have extensive experience in battling tough epidemics , in particular , could offer valuable lessons . <p> Finally , it will not be possible to implement any solution without effective , broad-based communication . In places like the UAE , religious leaders and institutions have used their reach and influence to disseminate critical public health messaging . Community-level engagement using village and other community elders is likely to be effective in circulating messages on preventive measures , as well as monitoring key developments in a localized manner .

Additionally , qualifying dependents aged 16 and under can add $500 to what their parent or household will receive . Thus , a married couple filing jointly with three young children could collect $3,900 in stimulus money . To qualify for this maximum payout , a single , married , or head-of-household tax filer would need to have earned less than $75,000 , $150,000 , and $112,500 , respectively , in adjusted gross income ( AGI ) in their most recent tax filing . <p> There 's absolutely no question that this stimulus money was needed by recipients to buy essential goods and pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact remains that this stimulus money did n't even last a month for approximately three-quarters of recipients .

Emergency Money for the People Act <p> First up is the Emergency Money for the People Act , introduced by Rep. Ro Khanna ( D-Calif. ) and Rep. Tim Ryan ( D-Ohio ) . The goal of this second stimulus proposal would be to provide up to $2,000 in monthly payouts to individuals , or up to $4,000 monthly to couples filing jointly , for a period of one year .

The idea here is to provide a refundable payroll tax rebate that 'll cover up to 80% of employer payroll costs , applicable up to the median wage . Even though this is n't going to put money into the pockets of working Americans , it 's going to lower costs for employers to retain their staff and presumably make it easier for businesses to ramp up activity once states are fully open again . <h> 3 .

Sherrod Brown ( D-Ohio ) plans to propose a second stimulus package that would pay $2,000 per individual every quarter . This echoes a proposal that Brown and a few colleagues introduced in March prior to the passage of the CARES Act , which called for an initial payment of $2,000 , a potential second payment of $1,500 , and , if needed , quarterly payouts of $1,000 per person . <p> Brown 's quarterly payout proposal is unique in that most existing stimulus efforts call for a monthly payment . <h> 5 .

Coming in at a $3 trillion cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from providing $1 trillion to states , $200 billion to provide hazard pay to essential workers , and extending unemployment benefit protections through January 2021 ( the extra $600 per week is set to end after July 31 , 2020 ) , it would also provide up to $1,200 per taxpayer and up to $6,000 per household . <p> While the payouts per individual and income eligibility requirements are the same as under the CARES Act , dependents are each worth up to $1,200 in added payout , rather than $500 , with a limit of three dependents .

Under the ABC Act , individuals would receive $2,000 monthly during a defined payment period ( lasting at least a year ) , with U.S. citizens , residents , and nonresident aliens in the country for at least three months all eligible for the payout . Making nonresident aliens eligible is what really allows the ABC Act to stand out from a crowded field of proposals . <p> It should also be noted that dependents would add $2,000 each during this initial payment period . Thus , a couple with two children would receive a whopping $8,000 monthly payment . <p> Furthermore , the ABC Act provides a recurring payout of $1,000 per eligible individual ( and a $1,000 kicker for each dependent ) for one year following the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would last two years . <p> Payments could be made traditionally ( e.g. , via direct deposit ) or with a BOOST prepaid debit card for those without a bank account . <h> 7 .

But many public health experts and scientific models cast doubts on the officials ' rosy conclusions . Ending a statewide lockdown too soon , experts said , could reverse any positive trends . If Gov . Brian Kemp lets a shelter-at-home order expire on Thursday , the state 's death toll ultimately could double , one new model predicts . The model was produced jointly by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . " I 'm not sure the worst is behind us because I 'm not sure where we are , " in part because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus , said Dr. Harry J.

" I 'm also not sure because the policy decisions we make going forward are very much going to determine whether our trajectory moves in a positive direction ... or whether we open the door to having a resurgence of cases and being right where we are in the first place . " Kemp will have to weigh these conflicting analyses as he plans Georgia 's next steps to revive an economy wrecked by weeks of limited business activity . Already he has allowed restaurants to resume dine-in service and certain other businesses -- such as hair and nail salons , gyms and tattoo parlors -- to reopen under strict conditions to minimize the virus ' spread . But a majority of Georgians surveyed by the University of Georgia think Kemp is moving too fast . The poll , released Tuesday , found that only 10% of Georgians opposed the statewide lockdown , while about 62% disapproved of Kemp 's initial steps to reopen businesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between April 21 and 25 , has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points . ?

Almost 25,000 Georgians have tested positive for the virus . Kemp has hinted that he is unlikely to extend the statewide lockdown for most Georgians past its scheduled expiration of 11:59 p.m . Thursday . However , he has ordered elderly and medically fragile residents to remain at home until at least May 13 . Other restrictions , such as bar closures , remain in force until that date .

" " We are seeing good signs that the actions Georgians have taken to mitigate coronavirus are paying off , " Toomey said , " and we are deeply grateful to all the people who have been fighting with us to flatten the curve . " She cited declines in reported flu-like illnesses and in emergency room visits by people exhibiting coronavirus symptoms , as well as a decrease in the rate of positive coronavirus tests . The White House urged states to demonstrate downward trends in all three indicators over 14 days before easing business restrictions .

The only decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- a period for which , the website says , data is incomplete .

Candice Broce , a spokeswoman for Kemp , said Georgia has " always " met two other White House criteria : boosting hospital capacity and a robust testing program for health care workers . But the graphs used different time frames to arrive at the averages , complicating a comparison of the data sets . Independent models offer a much more dire forecast . The latest model from the University of Washington 's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predicted Georgia will not reach its peak of daily deaths until Saturday , more than two weeks later than the nation as a whole . Earlier models said the peak of deaths had already passed . The model , based on social-distancing measures remaining in effect until June 28 , now predicts deaths in Georgia will exceed 2,400 by late June .

Many saw this as contradictory to the punitive , rather than restorative , response that is being applied through the criminalisation of the lockdown laws . We are concerned that this may discredit the very notion of restorative justice . <p> As organisations that actively support the concept of restorative justice , and have provided services in this field for many years , we applaud the release of 19,000 inmates on parole . In particular , we appreciate the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services ' reaffirmation of government 's commitment to restorative justice , and for emphasising that both victims and offenders need assistance . <p> The Detention Justice Forum has sent an open letter to the minister regarding the decision to release the inmates .

In many cases , these people will be experienced by their families and communities as adding to the burden of survival . Furthermore , these unusually adverse socio-economic conditions , together with the marginalisation and stigmatisation ex-offenders typically experience after release , increases their risk of reoffending . This does not detract in any way from the necessity of the minister 's decision and the responsible way in which he has chosen to implement it . <p> The potential of restorative justice processes becomes clear at this point . National and international research has indicated that restorative justice is effective not only in addressing relational harm between victims and offenders , as well as between offenders and broader communities , but also in reducing the likelihood of reoffending . <p> We share a deep concern , however , that in reality the capability to provide restorative justice services has become significantly depleted due to a lack of real support for many years .

For this reason , shortly after hearing that the virus had entered South Africa , our regional support office sent out Recommended Covid-19 Operational Guidelines and asked all our offices to shift business practices to virtual channels as far as possible as to minimise the spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our regional support office a full week before the rest of the country went into lockdown . <p> When I first heard of the lockdown , I commended the president for taking such a proactive stance .

Even though it is putting strain on our business and the greater economy , I have always believed that , as business owners and entrepreneurs , it is our duty to support this decision while doing what we can to keep our economy afloat by planning for business continuity after this period of isolation is over . <p> Comment on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on your company or economy as a whole . <p> Goslett : One would expect that the number of sales associates would shrink considering that no agent in the country can earn a single cent in sales commission right now because transactions have to be processed by the Deeds Office , which was closed in during lockdown ( level five ) . However , we 've had a net growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had 46 agents rejoin us over this time . Now more than ever , the backing of a well-established brand becomes invaluable to agents who are struggling to make ends meet on their own . <p> How is your company responding to the crisis ? <p> Goslett : The inability to meet with sellers and landlords face to face or show buyers and renters through a home means that the ability to earn an income is almost entirely halted . I have , therefore , taken the decision to cut all RE/MAX SA franchise and agent fees for the month of April by 50% . Although this decision will come at a significant cost to the business and dramatically impact certain services offered by our regional support office , who will also have their salaries cut in May , we feel that it is the right call to make to show solidarity with our people . We are all in this together . So much so that myself and our COO , Amanda Cuba , have cut our salaries by double that of our staff . <p> Goslett : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The opportunity exists in being the one who survives . The reality is that many will not make it through these tough market conditions . If you are able to survive , you will be one of the very few left to offer your services to the public . <p> How have you had to change the way you work ? <p> Goslett : RE/MAX has always been a frontrunner in terms of our advanced technology offering to our agents . We have continued to operate at full capacity , further developing our technology so that our agents can remain productive over this time . Our agents have been innovating and doing whatever they can to conclude successful transactions and property transfers over this time . This includes suggesting digital alternatives , including virtual walk-throughs where possible , digital advertising , face-time video calls and much more . <p> Goslett : There are things real estate professionals can do to minimise the downsides of this situation . Agents should still be following up with clients via virtual tours and face-time conversations , trying to line up as many sales as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the lockdown period is over . To protect buyers who purchase homes over this time , agents can draft OTPs with a suspensive condition that stipulates that the purchase will only go ahead once the home has passed a physical home inspection which can be conducted once the lockdown has been lifted . <p> Agents should also use this time to learn new skills in order to provide a better service to their customers . To this end , we 've released a plethora of online-based training courses , webinars and conference calls so that our agents have the opportunity to upskill and refresh over this time . We have also opened up our internal training platform to the public so that anyone who wants to explore the RE/MAX offering may freely do so . We have also arranged for top-notch speakers to provide free online inspirational talks for both real estate agents and the greater public . These talks will go live every Thursday for four weeks at 10am as of 24 April , via the RE/MAX of Southern Africa YouTube channel and Facebook page . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners , it was pointed out to us that the interest rate cuts have stimulated interest among buyers , as revealed by an increase in ' buy a home ' search terms during this period . However , it is unlikely that this peak in interest will result in too many sales as few South Africans will be able to afford to make such a large investment at this time . Sadly , the earning potential of many has been either directly or indirectly impacted as a result of Covid-19 .

As such the potential delay to the launch of the iPhone 12 -- the first with 5G capabilities -- would make Apple 's services businesses more important than ever to both company growth , and any short- to medium-term share price gains . <p> However , with some service lines performing better than others , the downward pressure on Apple 's share price could continue . <p> Apple TV+ falters <p> Apple 's TV streaming business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles and no back-catalogue .

The segment -- which includes Apple Arcade , Apple Pay , Apple Card , App Store , Apple TV + and Apple Music -- grew by 17% last year to reach nearly $50bn .

Their appeal is addressed to more than 15 large pharmaceutical companies around the world , such as Roche , Gilead and Johnson &amp; Johnson . <p> Leen Preesman <p> " For our pension savers , it is important that we ensure that the value that exists in these companies remains and grows over one , two and 20-year periods , " said Flod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the pandemic is over , he said , adding that AMF had a responsibility to ensure that its customers ' pensions were invested in firms that had long-term potential . <p> The pension fund , which is run on mutual principles said it had continued to invest despite recent market turbulence . <p> Recent deals included the increase of its equity stake in Swedish Hotel chain Scandic Hotels to 15% , AMF said , a SEK140m investment in Swedish wind power company Stena Renewable for the firm 's expansion , and a SEK280m investment in Swedish online supermarket MatHem . <p> The coverage ratios of Dutch pension funds could drop to below 70% if the crisis is lengthy , according to Willis Towers Watson ( WTW ) . <p> They could still bounce back to the level of 2019-end next year if the crisis turns out to be short , WTW said after assessing three scenarios . <p> The most optimistic of these assumes that the virus is brought under control before July , and that government support for households and companies turns out to be effective . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurring in the third quarter , combined with a worldwide recession , as well as a continuing low turnover for European and US companies in 2020 . <p> In WTW 's worst-case scenario , consumer confidence in Chinese exports will recover slowly , while unemployment in Europe and the US soars and companies go bust as a result of reduced financing options and credit facilities . <p> The main difference between the first and the second scenarios , which both include new COVID-19 cases in the third quarter , is the period that governments and banks need to support the economy , WTW said . <p> " Unless the social affairs ' minister Wouter Koolmees grants another leeway , this will lead to a reduction of pension rights and benefits at the pension funds with a consecutive funding shortfall in the past five years . " <p> Crisis leads to calls for early withdrawal <p> The COVID-19 crisis has reignited a debate in Austria over the long-term severance pay saving system , with a call for early withdrawals . <p> Wolfgang Katzian , president of the country 's Trade Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal of assets before the 36 month minimum period that applies under the current rule in cases of lost employment . <p> Under the Abfertigung Neu severance pay system , employers pay 1.53% of the gross salary from the second month of employment . <p> At the end of 2018 , some 3.5 million Austrians had saved ? 11.5bn in severance pay accounts with eight providers of betriebliche Vorsorgekassen . <p> Providers must offer a guarantee equal to the gross amount of contributions made and a maximum of 40% can be invested in equities . <p> However , the occupational severance pay funds umbrella group , Plattform der Betrieblichen Vorsorgekassen , said the ? GB 's proposal could be acceptable on the basis of a compromise that would include extending of the time the money remains in the accounts . <p> Across the globe , over 800,000 Australian pension savers have requested early release of part of their superannuation savings to tide them over the economic shutdown . <p> The number is double the account holders ( 361,000 ) who have accessed their savings prematurely over the past five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or A$2.9bn in total . <p> The nation 's largest super fund , AustralianSuper , expects to receive requests -- through the Australian Taxation Office , which is tasked with processing requests -- from over 300,000 members . <p> Such is demand for early release that questions have been raised about the ability of funds to meet obligations . There have been suggestions that the government might have to issue bonds to create liquidity . <p> Some conservative politicians blame the cash squeeze on industry funds for having invested in illiquid assets , such as infrastructure . <p> Luigi Serenelli &amp; Florence Chong <p> In the worldwide recession scenario , coverage ratio of Dutch pension funds would have recovered to approximately 95% on average at the end of 2021 , which is still about 10 percentage points short of the 2019 level . <p> The most extreme scenario assumes new hits on equity markets and long-term low interest rates . <p> In the UK , the aggregate deficit of defined benefit ( DB ) schemes potentially eligible for entry to the Pension Protection Fund ( PPF ) is estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? 135.9bn over March , the PPF announced in April . <p> This is equivalent to a fall in the funding ratio from 93.2% at the end of February to 92.5% at the end of March . <p> There were 114 more schemes in deficit at the end of March than a month previously , according to the new PPF figures . The shortfall of the schemes in deficit grew ? 9.3bn , from ? 244.8bn at the end of February to ? 254.1bn . <p> The change in the deficiency of schemes in deficit on a so-called section 179 basis is an illustration of the impact of changes in financial markets on the PPF 's total exposure . <p> A scheme 's s179 liabilities represent the premium that would have to be paid to an insurance company to take on the payment of PPF-levels of compensation . Schemes in surplus on an s179 basis at the time of insolvency usually do not enter the DB lifeboat fund . <p> A spokesperson for the ? 32bn PPF said the drop in schemes ' funding position over March was caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was partially offset by a decrease in liability values of about 1.6% due to an increase in index-linked bond yields . <p> Sion Cole , head of UK fiduciary business at BlackRock , said that since the start of the year funding levels have fallen 5.5% . " However , the variation around these figures will be significant , depending on the size of a scheme 's equity and credit allocations and amount of liability hedging , " he said . <p> " In short , it 's been a torrid start to the year for pension schemes and the volatility does not look set to disappear anytime soon . " <p> In April , the PPF said the COVID-19 outbreak was causing " daily changes to the way we work " . <p> Commenting on the fund 's business plan for 2020-21 , PPF chief executive officer Oliver Morley added : " The extent of the impact is , of course , unknown at this stage . We have chosen to leave our objectives as they stand but we accept that there may be challenges to achieving our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for beleaguered schemes and sponsors European pension funds and their sponsors are making use of regulatory relief through contribution holidays as firms battle for business survival . <p> In the Netherlands , Dutch pensions supervisor De Nederlandsche Bank ( DNB ) has said it will not object to pension funds deviating from their strategic investment plans " during the current extraordinary market conditions " . <p> However , it said that such decisions must be thoroughly underpinned , and take risk management into account . <p> It also highlighted that recovering pension funds will not be allowed to " deliberately and structurally " raise the risk profile of their investments . <p> The supervisor suggested that , given the changing economic conditions and worsening financial positions , pension funds should assess whether their current strategic investment policy still matches the risk attitude of their participants . <p> The supervisor has already offered pension funds the option to postpone submitting their monthly and quarterly reports . It has temporarily cancelled on-site investigations . <p> The DNB added that pension funds must put in a maximum effort to obtain pension premiums from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , emphasised that pension rights will remain if contributions are not paid , and a two-month leeway is legally possible . <p> At the launch of DNB 's annual report last month , Bos said the supervisor , the cabinet and industry organisations were discussing options in case of a continued crisis . " The question is whether and how the government 's emergency measures apply to employers ' premium payments , " she said . <p> The Dutch pension funds for the building , metal and cleaning sectors , hairdressers , hospitality workers , the travel industry and the retail sector have granted their affiliated employers leeway in paying their pension contributions . <p> The ? 67bn pension fund for the building industry ( BpfBOUW ) said that , in order to ease the pressure on employers , it had extended the term of payment until 1 June . <p> PMT and PME , the country 's pension funds for the metal sector , said they had also allowed affiliated employers to delay their contributions . <p> PME has granted a two-month leeway , while PMT allowed for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that tailored arrangements were possible for struggling firms . <p> PME said that its goal is to enable companies to easily apply a reduction of working hours , thereby improving their liquidity . <p> It added that it assumed that the government 's financial support will also offer a solution for the payment of pension premiums . <p> Peter Borgdorff , director of the ? 238bn healthcare scheme PFZW , added that about 200 employers were facing difficulties . He said that , instead of a general payment deferment , his scheme will assess requests case by case . <p> In the UK , more than 500 companies are likely to use new regulatory flexibilities and delay making pension deficit repair contributions ( DRCs ) according to a report from consultancy LCP in late April . <p> It estimated that about ? 500m ( ? 565m ) in total will be held back . <p> There have already been media reports that firms such as retailers Arcadia and Debenhams have sought to delay making DRCs . LCP says its analysis is the first industry-wide estimate of how widespread such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of data on more than 200 schemes for which it acts as an adviser . <p> This led to an estimate that at least 10% of sponsoring employers were likely to delay making contributions for at least three months . <p> Pension funds have had to adapt to social distancing working for operations such as trading while other staff have stayed at home . <p> In the Netherlands , some 100 of APG 's critical staff were still working in company offices last month . They represent people working in ICT , treasury and trading , as well as benefits payments . The company employs about 2,200 domestic workers . <p> The entire staff at APG 's New York office was working from home last month , while critical processes were run from the Netherlands . Hong Kong-based staff had restarted working in the office , albeit in separated teams , he said . <p> In Germany , BVK has had to reassess its internal organisation to follow social distancing , but it continues to " easily ensure " day-to-day business operations , with most of its employees currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support a constant exchange of information between the teams , according to CFO Andre ' Heimrich , adding that for several weeks now the fund 's internal task force has held regular virtual meetings . <p> The task force constantly evaluates the current situation and channels recommendations to take actions in terms of communication and internal processes . <p> These safeguards include that the companies must also be cutting back on dividends and bonuses and must have explored other methods of easing their cash-flow problems . <p> " The ability to agree with trustees a delay in making pension contributions will help them to weather the present storm and continue their support to the scheme in the long term . " <p> According to LCP , reasons for employers not seeking to take advantage of these easements included that their next contribution may not be due for some months , as some deficit contributions are only due annually or twice yearly . <p> In addition , some employers may consider that continuing to pay contributions now would support long-term plans for tackling the deficit . <p> Steve Webb , partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultancy had the impression some employers were trying to " reputation manage " , in that they would like to delay contributions but were aware of the potential implications , in terms of getting regulatory approval for a valuation on the basis of a strong employer covenant . <p> In Finland , moves by the government to help businesses cope with the immediate fallout will wipe out ? 1bn of contributions to occupational pension providers this year , and the sector faces other potential hits too , according to the Finnish Centre for Pensions . <p> The government has temporarily lowered earnings-related pension contribution requirements from employers by about 2% , and allowed businesses unable to operate during the crisis to postpone contributions completely for up to three months -- a measure agreed with la-bour-mar-ket organisations , it said . <p> The Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health confirmed in March that an exception was being granted for contributions due to the main occupational pension schemes -- TyEL for employees and YEL for the self-employed -- because of stretched economic conditions due to COVID-19 . <p> Jaak-ko Kian-der , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , statistics and planning , wrote : " The measures which have been decided upon will reduce the premium income of pension institutions by about ? 1bn for the current year .

@@71963941 <p> Owing to the unprecedented advent and enduring repercussions of the global invisible enemy , the novel coronavirus , Australia 's retail sector has seen significant structural change and disruption along with changes in consumer behaviour and competition associated with this disruption . Even though COVID-19 is primarily a health threat , it has severe ramifications for overall economic growth . And , retail activity is key to overall economic recovery . <p> Australian Retail Trend Amid COVID 19 <p> According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) , the seasonally adjusted Australian retail turnover fell 17.9% in April 2020 , marking the strongest seasonally adjusted fall ever published from the Retail Trade survey amid the COVID-19 crisis . This follows the strongest ever seasonally adjusted rise in March 2020 where it rose by 8.5% . <p> Director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys Ben James stated that the virus heavily impacted retail trade in March with unprecedented demand in food retailing ( the strongest seen in the history of the series ) , household goods , and other retailing . On the bleak side , sales dropped in cafes , restaurants , takeaway food services owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series ) . Discretionary spending in footwear , clothing , personal accessory retailing , as well as department stores was also shaky . In original terms , online retail turnover added 7.1% to total retail turnover in March 2020 . <p> April saw food retailing business plummet by 17.1% . Overall retail impacts in the month were devastatingly negative , owing to social distancing measures limiting the competence of businesses to trade as it does ideally . So much so , turnover in footwear , clothing , and personal accessory retailing , along with cafes , takeaways and restaurants was just about half of the April 2019 level . <p> Australian Retail Current Stance <p> Towards the end of April , Australia witnessed an awaited fall in the number of Coronavirus cases , though , as experts opine , it will take time to resolve the situation completely even after new cases stop altogether . With vigilance , the Federal Government decided to consider gradual and slow lifting of lockdown , an earlier-than-expected end to a five-week shutdown , as PM Scott Morrison aspires the Australian economy to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is contained . <p> Thanks to the easing of restrictions in some states and territories , Australian retailers have started to reopen stores after few weeks of decimated overall sales but fast-tracked e-commerce expansion . This is being done with health and safety of staff and customers as the top priority , using strict hygiene rules , customer limits and social distancing inside outlets . <p> However , amid the excitement of stores reopening and normalcy ( in the form of the " new normal " ) returning , there is some anxiety about the retail sector picking up its lost momentum in the fear of an economic downturn and uncertainty about ' second waves ' of the virus . An innovative transformation and rebirth of retailers is likely in the medium to long term along with ample opportunities , but not with the virus fear completely gone . <p> One of Australia 's largest listed companies with a diverse business operation cover , WES is Target Australia 's parent company . The Company recently intimated about a closure of 10 to 25 large format Target stores and remaining 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Target store support office . <p> Moreover , up to 92 Target stores are likely to be converted into Kmart outlets in the next 12 months , given WES ' enhanced investment in digital capabilities , sustained strong growth in online sales across the Kmart Group , satisfying progress in Catch since the 2019 acquisition . <p> Team members from Target that are planned to undergo a conversion to Kmart , will receive an employment offer from Kmart . Few will be gauged for new roles in Kmart as well as Catch as these businesses grow . The Company has also set up a cross-divisional working group to classify redeployment prospects . <p> Besides this , the following significant items are expected to be recognised by the Company in its FY20 results- <p> Restructuring costs and provisions in Kmart Group of $120 to $170 million before tax <p> Non-cash impairment in Kmart Group of $430 to $480 million before tax <p> Non-cash impairment in the Industrial and Safety division of $300 million before tax <p> Pre-tax gain on sale of 10.1 per cent interest in Coles of $290 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revaluation of the remaining Coles investment <p> Kmart Group is also expected to incur one-off non-operating costs of $120 to $140 million relating to the conversion of stores and stock clearance activity prior to closure or conversion in FY21 <p> An upmarket Australian department store chain , MYR had been closely monitoring government measures and advice with a view to reopening stores as soon as possible , on a staged and trial basis . MYR has also been taking all necessary measures to minimise costs and remains in dialogue with suppliers and landlords . <p> The Company has reopened 24 stores over the recent few weeks , considering government measures and conditions across the different states and territories . MYR also intimated that it witnessed a surge in online business , which continued to perform strongly amid the coronavirus crisis . <p> While Click and Collect services will be available at all stores nationally , from 27 May 2020 , MYR will reopen all of its remaining stores excluding Karrinyup ( WA ) , which is expected to reopen on 30 May 2020 post refurbishment works . <p> MYR ensures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision of hand sanitiser stations and contactless payments to protect the health and welfare of consumers and team members . <p> Operating the end-to-end automotive aftermarket supply chain , car parts retailer BAP recently and successfully completed its share purchase plan ( SPP ) after a successful $180 million placement . Close to 12.8 million new shares will be issued under the SPP on 25 May 2020 and commence trading . Strong demand encouraged Directors to nearly double the amount on offer by $26 million to $56 million . <p> This capital raising is complementary to a range of cost saving initiatives implemented by BAP to preserve and manage cash flow amid the coronavirus crisis including store closures in New Zealand , cutting executive salaries , eradicating discretionary expenditure , and requesting landlords for rent relief . <p> BAP last quoted $5.66 , down by 4.23% on 22 May 2020 . <p> It is true that if retailers do not focus on the customer , they face an arduous battle to stay alive - much less prosper .

However , some of these doctors were recently employed , and because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IPPIS to come down to Lagos to do the capturing . While that process is on , there should be some form of payment from locally generated funds . Doctors should be paid on a temporarily ground , " she said . <p> Jolayemi also complained that healthcare workers lacked basic protective equipment to work with as they battle COVID-19 in LUTH . <p> " As we speak , there are not enough face mask , gloves and even protective garments . Doctors still work in the Accident and Emergency ( A&amp;U ) unit without being properly equipped . There are some doctors who are on isolation who got exposed from another LUTH doctor who is COVID-19 positive . Now , you asked them to self isolate , how are they going to cope , these doctors have wives and kids and you expect them to go on 14-days with nothing to treat or cater for themselves , " Jolayemi said . <p> General Secretary , ARD , Dr. Hassan Jimoh , also lamented the non-payment of salaries to doctors due to the fact that they have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of protective kits for doctors in LUTH . <p> " They are not enough personal protective equipment ( PPEs ) especially the A&amp;E unit considering the fact that LUTH is one of the biggest hospitals in Lagos where a number of patients whom we do not know their health history come in . <p> " You can not turn them down , which puts some members at risk.The management of LUTH should borrow a leaf from the Lagos State government and give doctors some stimulus to cushion the effect of the hardship this pandemic has caused countries all over the world , " he said . <p> Chairman , Medical Advisory Committee ( CMAC ) , Prof. Wasiu Adeyemo , said the doctors that were not being paid were those who were newly employed before the outbreak of OVID-19 . According to him , the management has about 80 doctors in its payroll , so the ones that were not paid was due to the fact that those in-charge of IPPIS from Abuja could not come to Lagos to capture the newly employed doctors because of the lockdown.

@@71777741 <p> The coronavirus-induced panic that has caused the great run on toilet paper is not confined to the herd instinct of millions of shoppers . Fear of being the first government to preside over the end of 30 years of uninterrupted growth is gripping Scott Morrison and his entire Coalition outfit . <p> Forget the easy commentary -- that the prime minister talking about nothing but the virus and the end of the world as we know it is merely a distraction from his other worries . Rather , Morrison 's greatest single boast -- that he is the best economic manager on offer -- is crumbling before his very eyes . Sure , the other imbroglios he 's facing , such as the multimillion-dollar sports rorts scandal , are n't helping . In fact , every session of the senate inquiry is gnawing at his credibility . As is the dodginess of his Energy minister , Angus Taylor , which keeps bubbling to the surface , as it did in the New South Wales parliament estimates hearing this week . <p> But the No. ? 1 priority is getting Australians to identify with Morrison as our true leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience on Tuesday is a global health crisis that " will also have very real and very significant economic impacts , potentially greater than the global financial crisis " . He said this is " one of those national interest moments " . This was a prime minister striving to sound almost Churchillian in his appeal to the captains of industry facing a blitzkrieg of airborne virus droplets targeting their workers and , crucially , millions of workers and consumers in China , who make most of the things we buy from many of the things we sell them . <p> There was something " Captain Australia " about it when Morrison pleaded " we need your perseverance , your planning , your enterprise . We need your common sense , we need your calm , we need your commitment . But we need your patriotism as well . " That patriotism seems to involve companies risking putting themselves out of business by keeping their workers employed even if there is nothing for them to do and no money coming through the door to pay them . Morrison did say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room wondered how big a part and for how long . <p> Last year Morrison contorted his tenses during the 2019 election campaign to assure voters he had " already delivered a budget surplus next year " . The summer 's catastrophic bushfires closely followed by coronavirus have put paid to that . <p> Curiously Morrison claims his superior economic management has put Australia in one of the best positions of any developed country to meet the crisis . That may be true but it 's not really saying all that much unless Morrison is prepared to go deeper into debt than he has previously been willing to consider . The OECD certainly believes Australia is well positioned to go into deficit to stave off a recession , or at the very least lessen its impact and duration . <p> Here , ironically , the prime minister could take another leaf out of President Donald Trump 's book -- besides defining reality in his own terms . Debt is certainly not a dirty word to the United States president . His budget deficit is now topping a trillion dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in light of the buffeting the virus is giving the American economy and the danger signals coming from the volatility on world sharemarkets . <p> Morrison had better hope his stimulus and response to the virus works . The double whammy of a recession and a budget deficit that failed to work would be close to ignominious for him . <p> There have been various estimates from the Reserve Bank and Treasury of the impact the fires and the virus have had on the economy . The half-a-percentage-point hit to the March quarter is thought by many economists to be optimistic . ANZ Bank is predicting negative growth for the March and June quarters , tipping Australia into recession . A rule of thumb is a 50-basis-point drop takes $10 billion off the economy a quarter as measured by gross domestic product . Economist Stephen Koukoulas says to avoid a recession the government would need to " splash " $20 billion at the economy . Koukoulas , like others , however , believes the hit to the March quarter is closer to 1 percentage point . <p> On Thursday the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with immediate effect . It 's not enough to head off a recession by the Koukoulas calculus but it 's a serious start . <p> This is probably why former treasurer Peter Costello , who is also chair of the $170 billion Future Fund , believes the Morrison government may need a second round of stimulus in the May budget . He is confident the sharemarket will bounce back once the virus passes , but that could be 18 months away , with things getting worse before that . <p> Morrison tries to make a virtue of his failure to act more decisively earlier . He said it 's about being level-headed and learning from the mistakes of the Rudd government during the GFC . So there will be no new programs , and relief will be one-off and not " baked in " to the budget beyond the crisis . It sounds assuring for him and others beloved of fiscal conservatism , but he , like Rudd , is hostage to events he can not control . He can only react to them , and the boldness of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stimulus measures in the GFC . A second round , if it is required , as Costello muses , could see the Morrison government come close , unless he continues to put political campaigning ahead of governing . <p> China played a big role in Australia weathering the GFC with its increasing demand for our commodities , especially coal and iron ore . The irony this time is that our giant customer is also the genesis of the crisis . But , after a roundtable with Industry Minister Karen Andrews , the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia chief executive , Peter Strong , was taking heart that there were signs the virus was abating in China . He , like many , is hoping the worst could be over in three months , with supply chains by then functioning more normally . He was impressed that the minister seemed to be listening to the sector 's concerns but was disappointed the call for the Newstart unemployment benefit to be permanently raised by $90 a week , in order to immediately stimulate the retail sector , was ignored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-off cash handout of $750 . <p> Morrison had better hope his stimulus and response to the virus works . The double whammy of a recession and a budget deficit that failed to work would be close to ignominious for him . Some on the backbench think no matter what he and the treasurer throw at the crisis , they ca n't avert it . Morrison is hoping voters will accept none of it is his fault . That 's a courtesy the Liberals have not shown Labor over the past decade . Indeed , the taunts reached a crescendo after the delivery of last year 's " back in the black " budget surplus . <p> Labor has been at pains to appear " constructive " in its approach to the coronavirus . Privately it ca n't believe how inept the government has been . It has taken five weeks to get really serious . Last weekend Anthony Albanese and his Health spokesman , Chris Bowen , wrote to Morrison and Health Minister Greg Hunt with 18 points for the government 's consideration . Their suggestions were politely dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the big announcements this week . <p> Bowen waited until Tuesday to give voice to some of the key points that had been made . A government that had a political advertisement ready the day it announced its bushfire measures still had not come up with a public information campaign . The shadow minister called for GPs to be given more support and advice . Bowen said , " There needs to be a more broad-based information campaign . " You ca n't help thinking that if there were one on radio , TV and social media some of the irrational panic buying of toilet rolls may have been avoided . Health Minister Hunt responded by announcing a $30 million advertising campaign but that was n't due to begin until this weekend . On Wednesday Morrison and Hunt unveiled a $2.4 billion health package . <p> Bowen said the package fell short of " the response required urgently to prepare and respond to the crisis , leaving gaps in resourcing for primary care " and vulnerable populations more exposed . He said pop-up clinics will take six weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining up at hospitals for coronavirus testing . <p> Meanwhile , there is mounting evidence of the role Morrison 's office played in the allocation of $100 million in sports grants in exchange for vote-buying at the election . The senate inquiry heard evidence that then Sport minister Bridget McKenzie 's interference in the grants scheme was unlawful . McKenzie has denied any personal knowledge of late changes to sports grants after her signoff a couple of weeks before the election . And midweek Morrison brushed it all off when he was asked about it at one of his coronavirus news conferences . <p> Morrison is too busy urging voters to stay calm about their health while at the same time making sure they know it is under threat . <p> This article was first published in the print edition of The Saturday Paper on Mar 14 , 2020 as " Stimulating conversations " .

Has the target made use of or is it eligible to receive state emergency funding and if so under what conditions ? Does the target have appropriate crisis management policies and contingency plans ? <p> Impact on SPA terms <p> Purchase price : In split signing and closing , buyers are likely to push for a later valuation date , insisting on a closing accounts mechanism , so that interim negative impacts on the business can be captured in the price . Sellers will likely prefer the certainty of a historic pricing point and a locked-box mechanism . Hybrid mechanisms can also be used where the price is set by reference to locked-box accounts , but certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( via net debt adjustment ) and working capital . Adjustments could work either as a two-way euro-for-euro adjustment against an assumed/expected level , or an adjustment to only occur if the minimum assumed/expected level is not met . The closing accounts process provides protection as of closing ( and so only until then ) . As a post-closing protection in case the pandemic has longer term repercussions , buyers could seek deferred consideration provisions , retention of part of the purchase price or an earn-out . Sellers will resist a mechanism that links price to performance post-closing , as they will have limited or no control over the target business after closing . Such structures will be more common in the sale of a majority or minority stake , as the seller retains some influence over the business . Earn-outs may introduce significant pricing uncertainty because of complex adjustments , including to mitigate any adverse impact of choices made by the buyer in crisis times post-closing . <p> Conditions precedent / Long-stop date : Clearances ( e.g. merger control ) , consents or approvals from governmental authorities to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may delay the closing . Dealmakers should generally allow for extra time when setting deadlines for filings or formation of new SPVs , but also consider whether to add provisions for automatic extension of deadlines and/or the long-stop date where the delay is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or measures for its containment . <p> Pre-closing covenants : Pre-closing covenants are essentially about ensuring that the target companies continue their " ordinary course of business " until the time of their handover to the buyer . A question will arise as to what is ordinary in our current times , and how quickly the target company should react to imminent challenges . Obligations to refrain from taking certain actions without the buyer 's approval may conflict with the target 's need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and limit exposure . Sellers will need an exemption from these covenants to be able to take emergency measures to preserve the business . Buyers will seek an increased involvement in the pre-closing conduct of the business , with the risk of pushing the boundaries of competition law restrictions . Given restrictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for virtual access rights and other online solutions . <p> Warranties and disclosures : While there is no one-size-fits-all solution in M&amp;A deals , it is fairly common for buyers to insist on repetition of seller 's warranties at closing . If repetition will be a default or rather an exception , if there will be specific exclusions related to COVID-19 risks , what will be the value of pre-closing disclosures ? These will be strong negotiation points in forthcoming M&amp;A deals , in conjunction with all other limitations of seller 's warranties typically found in transactions of this type . Buyers may insist on specific representations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic . Sellers may seek a general COVID-19 related exclusion of liability . Ring-fencing ( i.e. if COVID-19 related claims can only be made under specific warranties and not under general warranties such as the accounts warranties ) , the buyer 's knowledge , changes in the law and other limitations will also be relevant . <p> With regards to warranty and indemnity insurance , the expectation is that the underwriting process will include detailed questions on the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis recovery policies and compliance with them . Where satisfactory answers to questions from the underwriters are not provided , or where certain impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are already known risks , there may be exclusions from the insurance coverage . It is possible to see a rise in the key man insurance policies . <p> MAC/MAE : Material Adverse Change ( " MAC " ) clauses have already been in the spotlight after the economic crisis , as many market players understood the significance of sudden changes in the economic circumstances of a deal . Since the COVID-19 outbreak in China , SPAs have cautiously shifted towards more specific MAC clauses , some of them pinpointing the pandemic as a MAC if coupled with a significant disruption of the business or an actual ( as opposed to anticipated future ) financial impact or linked to a specific risk ( like termination of essential contracts ) . While still a negotiation point , we will likely soon witness increased pressure from buyers to negotiate broader MAC clauses . On the other hand , once it becomes an established reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless coupled with extraordinary consequences or to the extent the target business is affected disproportionately to its industry . <p> Obviously , in an agreement signed today , a situation caused by COVID-19 may no longer qualify as a " change " but rather as an " effect " , which may prompt a shift towards Material Adverse Effect ( " MAE " ) clauses . Is the MAE measured on the target business as a whole or by reference to a specific financial metric ( e.g. EBITDA reduction ) or by reference to another KPI ?

This is crucial as crises tend to shake citizens ' confidence , and ensuring their trust is critical for an effective campaign . <p> Next , both the response and recovery demanded behavioural change to minimise impacts and avert future crisis . Efforts to bring such change were more effective with closer community engagement , which helps sensitise response and recovery to local norms and practical needs . This required engagement with local and religious leadership who have great influence over their communities .

But such plans have never been drawn up before ; there are no ready-made solutions . While the government will need to bring well-resourced programmes and policies for accelerated recovery into the five-year planning frame , United Nations with UNDP as the overall technical lead is also offering support to all affected countries . <p> Multi-sectoral recovery interventions has to include helping the health sector stabilise ; assisting the worst-hit people to weather the crisis ; restoring small businesses so they can provide access to livelihoods , and prompt restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these will bolster social stability . <p> The pandemic has resulted in more inequality than ever before , and has also highlighted the heavy price the planet has been paying for unsustainable economic growth . The UN Secretary General has renewed a call for global solidarity and appealed for recovery pathways to clean , green , and more responsible consumption . <p> UNDP has been a longstanding partner of Bangladesh in various key areas of development , from addressing urban poverty to climate change to the Rohingya refugee crisis . Our work here has helped take Bangladesh forward in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , but now , we must rethink our approach in achieving them within the 2030 target . In fact , the SDGs are more important now than ever -- social discrimination and inequality is on the rise , making SDG-10 a top priority . Meanwhile , this crisis and the subsequent shutdown has shown the importance of letting nature into our lives , to allow it to heal , increasing the priority of environmental and conservational goals . <p> Along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , USAID , Swedish SIDA , DANIDA , Australian DFAT , the EU , Canadian GAC , philanthropic foundations and several private sector partners is already working to support the poor across Bangladesh , while also trying to better prioritise response and recovery , and learning new lessons . <p> We are realising the critical need for proper coordination not just within the public sector but also between the public and private sectors . I have always maintained from my own experience that such coordination needs to be " dedicated , full-time , and necessarily empowered to be decisive " . With improved coordination the speed and effectiveness will undoubtedly increase , enabling better risk-sharing between public and private sectors as the debate on " lives versus livelihoods " hits centre-stage . <p> This pandemic is telling us to entirely rethink development .

" <p> Business Insider talked to Diaz about how Google.org is helping amid the coronavirus pandemic , his advice for why everyone should be helping right now , and how he takes care of himself after working through a crisis . <p> This interview has been edited for length and clarity . <p> Tell me about something you 've worked on that gets to the heart of what you do at Google.org ? <p> We have a program that called the Google.org fellowship -- I have n't seen anything like it , I 'm super proud of it .

@@41893241 <p> Besides the widespread and persistent domestic economic shock , as in the great influenza pandemic , the coronavirus crisis is occurring in a highly interconnected global economy , with China and other critical nerve centres of the world trade largely or wholly disabled . <p> The coronavirus shock is beginning to deflate an enormous credit bubble , which was likely to burst in any case .

The Australian dollar , which appreciates visibly when China expands , is still testing the lows . <p> Moreover , even when China tries to normalise production , other countries must be ready to buy and sell . If , as now appears , the crisis will persist longer in Europe , China 's ability to pump up its own and global growth will remain constrained . Meanwhile , emerging markets -- Argentina , Brazil , Mexico , Turkey -- are also financially stressed as foreign capital is fleeing to the relative safety of U.S. dollar assets . For these reasons , restoring the global trade network and , hence , global recovery will take time . The prospect of a bounce back later this year , as many forecasters had hoped -- and continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking note <p> The first impact of the economic crisis was on stock markets . In that initial assessment , stock markets recognised that Italy would be hardest hit . <h> Stock markets took a bleak view of Italian economic prospects <p> ( February 18 , 2020 = 100 ) <p> However , though stock indices were in free fall , there was initially no financial crisis . But danger lurked in the global credit bubble that had reached a dangerous peak . According to the Washington-based Institute of International Finance , the global debt outstanding doubled from ? 97bn ( $120bn ) in 2006 to ? 195bn ( $240bn ) in 2019 , reaching 320 per cent of world GDP . Every country and every type of borrower took advantage of the low interest rates to gorge on debt . Debt ratios rose especially for corporates and governments , and while the ratios for banks in advanced economies declined , they remained higher than those for other types of borrowers . <p> In the second week of March , once the economic threat of the coronavirus became clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , and are , relatively modest compared to levels observed during the most intense phase of the global financial crisis between July 2007 and May 2009 . Remember though that in that crisis financial tensions rolled mercilessly across various credit markets . As the epicenter of the crisis shifted to the eurozone , the cost of credit to companies , banks , and governments rose sharply . <p> There is reason to worry that the visible credit market tensions will increase and spread . Generally , financial crises are severe not just when outstanding debt burdens are high but , potentially more acutely , when growth slows down rapidly , making it hard to repay that debt . Today , with a sharp decline in output and high debt burdens a question mark hangs over the ability of borrowers to repay the that debt . <h> Policymakers responded energetically <p> The Fed set the ball rolling by lowering interest rates ( by reducing its policy rate and renewing bond purchases ) , injecting liquidity into the U.S. banking system and making dollar liquidity available to several central banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unlimited amounts , while backstopping other credit markets . The Bank of England took actions to lower rates and provide liquidity . The European Central Bank ( ECB ) has not reduced its policy rate but expanded its bond purchases to around a trillion euros for the rest of this year and added liquidity into eurozone banks . <p> These are important actions in a conventional financial crisis but , in the current context , plasters for a trauma patient . As long as spending is constrained by physical limits on movements and by the shutdown of factories and services to contain the virus , lower interest rates can not help . Liquidity into banks supports ongoing operations ; it does not spur new activity . <p> Fiscal measures , properly targeted , could be more effective . On March 20 , the Chancellor Rishi Sunak set the benchmark with a bold promise : ' Government grants will cover 80 per cent of the salary of retained workers up to a total of ? 2,500 a month . ' He promised unlimited interest free loans for 12 months to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants . Such economic life support is crucial to sustain those who are losing their livelihoods and need to pay for food , utilities , and mortgages . Other targeted help -- such as more generous family leave -- will also provide a critical safety net . In Europe , Germany , with an immediate injection of about 4.5 per cent of GDP and other support has , so far , the most aggressive stimulus . The U.S. , as with monetary policy , has the largest fiscal stimulus of around 9 per cent of GDP . <p> In a second phase , once the worst of the virus contagion is behind us but when financial stress , even a debt default crisis , is still with us , a more generalised spending stimulus will help boost the economy through spending multipliers and by instilling greater optimism . <p> But there is an immediate task at hand . Borrowers will soon begin defaulting on their loans , creating a new set of challenges for policymakers . The question , at its core , will be : how will the losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written down , or will debtors be allowed to repay debt over longer periods of time ? <h> Why Europe is so vulnerable <p> European economies entered 2020 in a weak economic condition . Since then the coronavirus hit their domestic economies hard . And because they are enmeshed in global trading relationships , their distress is acute . <p> European financial vulnerabilities are also severe . Government debt-to-GDP ratios in major eurozone nations -- other than Germany -- are near historical highs . European banks are fragile . While the banks ' non-performing loans are down , their profitability is low . The market-to-book value ( MBV ) ratios of major European banks were below one before the coronavirus peaked . With the virus , the market 's assessment became bleaker . MBV ratios fell sharply . Germany 's Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank MBV ratios are around 20 per cent . And Deutsche Bank just warned investors it will be ' materially adversely affected ' by the downturn . <p> Each of these European weaknesses is especially acute in Italy : prior economic infirmity , size of the coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domestic banking system . The Italian government owes about ? 2 trillion ( ? 2.3 trillion ) , or 135 per cent of GDP . Italian banks have assets with a paper worth of about ? 4.4 trillion ( ? 5 trillion ) . The true worth of the banks ' assets is likely lower and will fall further as the economy struggles in coming quarters . Italy 's Monte de Paschi bank has non-performing loans of about 17 per cent of its assets . Even the strongest banks -- UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo -- have MBV ratios significantly below one . <h> Treacherous moments -- and terrible choices -- lie ahead for Europe <p> Eurozone governments can not fiscally support a prolonged crisis . The German government , with the strongest fiscal position among eurozone members , plans to borrow about ? 307bn ( ? 350bn ) , approximately ten per cent of German GDP . Recapitalising the country 's banks may impose additional demands on the German government . The French and Spanish governments , with debt ratios of around 100 per cent of GDP , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , can increase their budget deficits to 15-20 per cent of GDP before credit markets and rating agencies take fright . But , in addition to protecting themselves , are the Germans fiscally and politically willing and able to aid those unable to spend their way out of this crisis ? <p> Three weeks ago , it seemed to me appropriate for Italy to receive a precautionary credit line , anchored by the eurozone 's bailout fund , the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) . But as the crisis has continued its fearsome course , and now threatens Spain with a financial crisis , the ESM clearly lacks adequate firepower . Moreover , the ESM lends to countries in distress , and Italy and Spain need more than loans . They need sizeable fiscal transfers ( in the hundreds of billions of euros ) , grants of the type built in for states -- although inadequately so -- in the U.S. stimulus package . Grants on this scale are taboo in Europe , where the political discussion is still centred around various alternative lending mechanisms . <p> Eurozone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the day . The ECB could keep buying the Italian government 's debt to prevent a default . But it is not the task of a central bank to deal with insolvencies . Moreover , such an effort would be technically and politically fraught for the ECB , which is not a normal central bank . The ECB is the central banker to a confederation of nations , each of which maintains fiscal sovereignty . If Italy is pushed to the brink , the ECB will struggle to help . The current ECB bond-buying limit of a trillion euros is designated to purchase the bonds of all member states . Italian government debt is over two trillion euros , which will increase further if the government is forced to financially prop up the country 's banks . If Italy is bailed out , other member states on the ECB 's Governing Council will face buying so much Italian debt that the ECB would own Italy . If then , the Italian government is unable to service its debt to the ECB , other member states will face the charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's capital . <p> Alternatively , leaving Italy to fend for herself could cause widespread Italian defaults , triggering defaults by those who have lent to the Italian government and banks . A cascade of defaults would go up the chain to European and global pension and insurance funds , inducing a global financial panic . <p> At this moment of global crisis , the test is going to be whether each nation takes care only of itself or whether the strong help the weak .

Mike Gilday recommended that Navy Capt . Brett Crozier be returned to his ship , said the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the results of an investigation that have not yet been made public . <p> If approved , his recommendation would end a drama that has rocked the Navy leadership , sent thousands of USS Theodore Roosevelt crew members ashore in Guam for quarantine and impacted the fleet across the Pacific , a region critical to America 's national security interests . <p> Gilday met with Gen. Mark Milley , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , on Tuesday and with Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Friday morning to lay out his recommendations . An official said Esper has asked for a delay in any public announcement while he considers the recommendation . <p> Earlier in the day , Esper 's chief spokesman Jonathan Hoffman had suggested that Esper was going into the matter with an open mind , and said " he is generally inclined to support Navy leadership in their decision .

There have been ongoing questions about whether Navy leaders took too long to acknowledge the ship 's problems and if other commanders share blame for not being responsive to Crozier 's concerns . <p> One senior defence official said the investigation covered a complex timeline of communications that spanned multiple time zones and military commands . The official said Esper wants to make sure the report is thorough and stands up to scrutiny . <p> Rep.

His return to the ship would reunite him with crew members so upset about his firing that many crowded together on the deck and applauded and chanted his name as he strode off the ship . <p> As of Friday , 856 sailors on the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the virus and four are hospitalized .

Sailors who test negative after time in quarantine are suddenly showing symptoms a day or two later . The virus ' bewildering behaviour , which is challenging the broader international medical community . is making it harder to determine when the carrier might be able to return either to duty or head home . <p> Gilday 's recommendations were first reported by The New York Times . <p> Crozier was fired April 2 by Modly after sending an email to several naval officers warning about the growing virus outbreak and asking for permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an extraordinary move that would take the carrier out of duty in an effort to save lives . <p> " We are not at war . Sailors do not need to die . If we do not act now , we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset , our sailors , " Crozier said in the memo . <p> Modly complained that Crozier " demonstrated extremely poor judgment " in the middle of a crisis , saying the captain copied too many people on the memo , which quickly went public . Modly also asserted that Crozier had improperly allowed sensitive information about the ship 's condition to become public . <p> A few days later , Modly flew out to the ship and delivered a profanity-laced condemnation of Crozier over the loudspeaker to the crew . Crozier , he said , may have been " too naive or too stupid " to be commanding officer of the ship . <p> Just hours after his comments were widely reported , Modly apologized . But the next day , in the face of widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing of Crozier , saying he made a " very tough decision . " But other military leaders , including Gilday , internally opposed the firing , saying an investigation should be conducted first . <p> Modly 's trip to the carrier cost him Esper 's support . Esper first demanded Modly apologize and a day later accepted his resignation . <p> President Donald Trump has expressed seemingly contradictory views on the matter . He initially blasted Crozier , calling his memo " terrible . " But a short time later he softened his take , saying he did n't want to destroy someone who may just have " had a bad day .

SMEs and microenterprises in South Korea are similarly feeling the heat . <p> It is in this context that Singapore 's aggressive use of counter-cyclical economic tools to support this segment of the economy is notable . With an expected economic slowdown due to COVID-19 , the Government announced the Stabilisation and Support Package ( SSP ) to support employment together with the Care and Support Package ( CSP ) to support households . <p> The SSP will continue to fund enhanced programmes such as the Jobs Support Scheme and offer improved support such as the Enhanced Wage Credit Scheme . These schemes may benefit employers directly by subsidising the cost of labour at this point in time but ultimately aids workers by helping them keep their jobs . <p> FEAR OF PROPPING UP ZOMBIE FIRMS <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firms , some may express concerns we are wasting precious limited resources to prop up unproductive firms , which would have seen some natural level of attrition during a down cycle . <p> However , in the context of the SSP , these concerns may be unfounded . <p> Firstly , unproductive firms require disproportionately more support than productive firms in a downturn . Discretionary support that provides unequal levels of financing and grants without considering a firm 's credit worthiness would be required to prop up these firms . <p> By contrast , key schemes in the SSP do not negate commercial discipline . The enhancement to the Enterprise Financing Scheme will require financial institutions to consider firms ' credit worthiness , even as the Government co-shares the risk of default . <p> The Corporate Income Tax rebates target firms earning a profit . Enhancements to the Wage Credit Scheme targets firms that have raised the salaries of workers in the last quarter . <p> The design of such schemes can reduce the mismatch between resource allocation and long-term profitability of a firm . <p> Second , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volatility of productivity may vary over a firm 's life cycle , young companies often find themselves in the red . <p> In assessing the potential impact of these measures on unproductive companies , we must distinguish between high-growth but young companies that may be burning through cash and zombie firms . <p> Zombie firms are non-performing companies , with little business activity and value-add . The term refers to firms that struggle for years , earning low sales , generating low growth and little meaningful employment , with little hope of resurrection , where they copy old ideas instead of pursuing innovation . <p> Many of such low-growth firms may have high debt ratios , fuelled by cheap borrowing in recent years . <p> Temporary measures such as the Job Support Scheme and Wage Credit Schemes will not keep them going after the SSP runs its course . <p> SIMILAR CHALLENGES FACED BY YOUNG , HIGH-GROWTH START-UPS <p> Young high-potential firms on the other hand may face cash flow issues in their initial years , as they pursue breaking even on their initial start-up costs , establish a brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start-ups in rapidly growing sectors like deep tech and artificial intelligence where sunk costs in research and development may take some time to recuperate . <p> Younger companies also tend to experience greater volatility in income compared to older firms , as they seek to grow new revenue streams and pivot their product offerings towards stronger enterprise solutions . <p> But if this higher volatility leads to higher financial costs , young and potentially high-growth firms could be wiped out along with zombie firms during a recession . <p> Fortunately , the most promising high-growth young start-ups have access to investors and government grants , through a plethora of schemes rolled out by the Government under Start-up SG . <p> The COVID-19 outbreak will pass .

@@71840441 <h> Coronavirus : A resilient supply chain is need of the hour <p> Amitabh Kant , Kowthamraj V.S Coronavirus has impacted millions and killed overthirty thousand people already across the globe since its emergence in Wuhan , China , in December last year . It has forced people to quarantine , socially distance themselves and compelled nations to lock down their populations . It will cause the biggest destruction to global economy ever witnessed , leading to a major slump in global GDP . In India , we arewitnessingthe lockdown of 18% of the world 's population for a three-week period . This has huge implications on the flow of goods and commodities for daily existence of citizens as well as ensuring supplies of essentials to confront the pandemic itself . In this atmosphere of uncertainty , the biggest risk faced by all nations is the potential breakdown of their healthcare system , resources and supply chain . Covid-19 's countries have witnessed a dramatic demand for medical supplies , test kits , respirators , masks , tubes , robes , thermometers , hazmat suitsand health workersprecisely at a time when the traditional global supply chainsare shutting down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its economy , South Korea analyzed what had gone wrong . There were n't enough test kits , which resulted in people with MERS shuttling from one hospital to another just to get a confirmation of their diagnosis . Also , nearly 83% of the transmission was due to just five ' super-spreaders ' -44% or nearly 81 of the 186 MERS-affected people had been exposed in nosocomial transmission at 16 hospitals . What if an elaborate testing regime had tested , contact-mapped and isolated those five people to contain the spread in time ? One of the reasons for lower testing frequency is the challenges in large-scale availability of testkits and allied medical supplies . Most virus-detecting kits are available only in big cities.The pandemic does not recognize geographical boundaries , race , ethnicity and economic status . Shoring up the healthcare system alone will not make any region resilient to future pandemics , some of which might even be more dangerous than Covid-19 . The world has to think differently ; it has to think better . The fact of the matter is that an excellent healthcare system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intensive care units and associated survival tools required in a pandemic will be enormously higher than normal . This underscores a need for an enormous supplychain ramp-up at short notice . The traditional healthcare supply chain , for the most part , comprises sets of highly specialized and relatively small factory units . Achieving scale is not a decision ; it is a skill . Scaling needs high-volume planning , credit , global infrastructure , social capitaland sophisticated deal-making . That is why even in China , the traditional healthcare supplychain was not enough to meet the demand of survival tools like masks . China 's BYD ( EV and battery maker ) appointed a task force comprising 3,000 engineers to build production lines at an existing plant in Shenzhenusing 90% of in-house components . They became the world 's largest mask-maker in a month . Most healthcare companies neither have those many engineers nor the production capacity and tooling in a single unit . Tata and Mahindra in India are now gearing up to produce crucial supplies like ventilators . Health workers take on a disproportionate share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India because it faces a severe shortage of doctors and nurses . In China and Italy , the fight against coronavirus has taken a huge toll on health workers . Protecting health workers who are in the forefront of the response is critical . The necessitates that we ensure personal protection kits-gloves , coverall , goggles , N-95 masks , shoe covers , face shield , triple-layer medical masks-and facilitate adequate food and resting facilities in hospitals . We greatly appreciate that the Government of India has provided Rs 50 lakh health insurance for all health personnel . We have faced five pandemics in the last 20 years ( one pandemic every five years ) . If countries have to become truly resilient to pandemics , it is imperative that they embrace the concept of ' dormant consortium ' . In essence , digital models of pandemics should be built and countries should put the best supply-chain experts of different industries in a room and request them to find out the synergies that even they did n't know existed to tackle the scenarios.Governments should identify companies ( auto , electronics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make certain categories of essential supplies at scale and club them together with specialized healthcare firms . A watertight , time-limited intellectual property agreement can be designed . An empowered representative from regulatory and standards ' agencies should be made part of the consortium . A big clothing company can not be made to wait for a long time to get necessary approvals for hazmat suit production . These multiple dormant consortium will come to life when the Government declares an imminent pandemic . Electronics and semiconductor manufacturers who have millions of workers trained to handle thousands of sophisticated cleanrooms ( which mandate full-body clean suits ) will have a huge role to play in pandemic-resilient supply chains . Since copper kills most microbes , pandemic-adaptive packaging can be sourced from copper foil suppliers to the battery industry . Distribution infrastructure of companies such as Amazon , Flipkart , Swiggy , Uber , Ola can be used to enable mass collection ( by trained social workers ) of swab samples to protect the healthcare workers . A reserve army of healthcare workers should be created to manage a pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial establishments have been closed down , exemptions have been provided for shops dealing with food , groceries , fruits and vegetables and delivery of all essential goods , including food , pharmaceuticals , medical equipment , through e-commerce .

@@71850141 <p> This is the first report in a series that provides glimpses into the impact of COVID-19-related policies on life in rural India . The series , commissioned by the Society for Social and Economic Research , comprises reports by various scholars who have been conducting village studies in different parts of India . The reports have been prepared on the basis of telephonic interviews with key informants in their study villages . This article focuses on the disruption of economic activity on the villages of Alabujanahalli and Siresandara in Karnataka as a result of the lockdown declared on March 24 , based on telephonic interviews conducted on March 31 and April 1 . <p> Alabujanahalli is located in Mandya district of Karnataka and the major crops grown here are rice , sugarcane , finger millet , and sorghum . The kharif crop ( June to October ) of rice requires intensive irrigation , and large-scale farmers hire workers to undertake the transplantation and harvesting of rice in this period . Pre-kharif rice cultivation is usually done by small farmers with fewer irrigation facilities between February and May . This phase in the village is a lean period with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siresandara is in Kolar district . Here , farmers cultivate vegetables and finger millet between October and February . Vegetable cultivation is undertaken by large cultivators , while finger millet is grown by everyone in the village for home consumption . <p> In addition to agriculture , dairying and sericulture are important economic activities in both the villages and are primarily dependent on labour by women.In sericulture , the task of feeding leaves to worms and plucking cocoons from sericulture mountages are mostly carried out by women . Women are also responsible for most of the work related to livestock , including cleaning animal sheds , milking and depositing milk . <p> Since the lockdown on March 24 , farmers in Siresandara have been affected by disruption in transport services and in market procurement . Perishable horticultural crops can not be stored and there are no advanced post-harvest storage facilities in the village . This has led to the loss of a large quantity of cauliflowers , tomatoes , ridge gourds , and broad beans because of the farmers ' inability to take them to the market . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of February , and continued until the first week of March , after which farmers found it difficult to sell their produce . <p> Availability of labour is not a major constraint in Siresandara , as most are hired from within the village . " We are getting workers to harvest , but how will we pay them , if we can not sell our produce ? " asked respondent RC , who is a large-scale peasant in the village , and had cultivated tomatoes , ridge gourds , and broad beans on around eight acres of land . <p> Another respondent , SU , echoed similar worries , as he had to abandon two acres of his cauliflower crop because of inability to take the produce to the market . SU saideven if he had found a way to transport the produce to the first-stage market in Kolar town , he would not have been able to sell it because the prices had plunged , causing panic among large and medium farmers . <p> Both these respondents were unaware of the recent advisory from the Home Ministry exempting agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demand for the vegetables from neighbouring cities fell with the closure of canteens and restaurants . Transporting produce to markets in neighbouring states has also not been possible because of the lockdown . <p> In Alabujanahalli , sugarcane harvesting and transplantation of pre-kharif rice crop were underway when the lockdown was declared . Since the latter is done by local women workers , the work was completed without interruption . However , sugarcane cultivators had to face problems , as they enter into labour contracts with the factory to mitigate labour shortage , and the sugar factory in Mandya district sends migrant workers from Bellary on piece-rated contracts to harvest sugarcane . Around 60% of these migrant workers were sent back after being paid for the number of days they had worked . <p> The remaining 40%of the labour was accommodated in shelters in the village and the cultivators arranged for cooked food to be provided to them . The factory has been allowed to continue procuring produce until April 4 , 2020 , but it is unclear whether the sugarcane cultivators will be paid before the closure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements , if any , will be made for the remaining migrant workers . <p> Sericulture is also a significant part of the incomes and livelihoods of people in both these villages , and Karnataka is home to Asia 's second largest cocoon market ( Ramanagara ) . <p> " I had 300 kilograms of cocoons to be sold at the market , but with the lockdown , the markets for cocoons are suspended . I have offered to sell the cocoons at a lower price to households within the village , but everyone is afraid to start a new cycle given the situation " , said respondent SU from Siresandara . <p> A respondent from Alabujanahalli voiced similar concerns . " I could not sell my produce as the market is temporarily shut . I have sold some produce in an informal channel at Rs 150 per kg of the cocoon , the price of which otherwise would be Rs 500 per kg " . <p> The procurement of cocoons has ceased as exports have been temporarily suspended , which has adversely impacted those engaged in sericulture .

A factory worker at KOMUL ( Kolar-Chikkaballapura Cooperative Milk Producers ' Union Limited ) dairy said the milk factory was open only for pasteurising milk and preparation of curd . Other activities , such as the preparation of sweets , have ceased since the lockdown was announced . The factory is currently running with less than 50% of the workforce ; most of whom hail from nearby villages and have been paid for the month . There has been a decline in milk sales over the past couple of days because of the closure of street tea shops , restaurants and office canteens in nearby towns . <p> Although livestock owners in Siresandara continued to deposit milk at the procurement centre , there is fear that procurement might be suspended if there is a further decline in milk demand . Alabujanahalli is facing similar issues . As a respondent put it , " Money from dairying is a source of regular cash flow .

Peasants have been using their already purchased stock of feed and fodder for their animals , but they are unsure of how they will replenish these . Poultry farmers have also suffered income losses from the abrupt decline in demand because of rumours that COVID-19 spreads from consumption of poultry and meat . <p> Landless Workers Worst Hit <p> Landless manual workers are among the worst affected by the lockdown . While peasants have some stocks of finger millet , landless workers have none , and the loss of employment they have faced in the past two weeks could seriously compromise their food security ( a few had sown finger millet on small patches of land in November and December last year ; this crop was harvested in February ) . <p> Women wage workers who are employed in the harvesting of crops and sericulture within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though they are willing to participate in field operations .

( File Photo by CDC/Unsplash ) <p> MANILA -- The coronavirus disease 2019 ( Covid-19 ) pandemic has triggered a decline in global trade value by 3 percent in the first quarter of the year , according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) data . <p> The report by the Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities ( CCSA ) attributed the lower value in global trade to falling commodity prices mainly due to plummeting world oil prices . <p> The declining crude prices in the world market are caused by uncertainties brought by the Covid-19 pandemic , which has infected over 4.26 million individuals and has killed more than 292,000 worldwide . <p> " Global merchandise trade volumes and values were showing modest signs of recovery since late 2019 when the global economy was hit by the measures taken to contain the Covid-19 pandemic , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implemented lockdowns that suspended many economic activities . <p> In the Philippines , Metro Manila and other parts of the country have been placed under enhanced community quarantine for two months until May 15 . <p> But the UNCTAD forecasted that global trade value will further drop in the second quarter of the year . <p> " Most of the impact of these measures , however , will affect global trade in the second quarter of the year , with an estimated quarter-on-quarter decline of 26.9 percent , " it added . <p> " Everywhere , governments are pressed to make post-Covid-19 recovery decisions with long-lasting consequences , " UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said in a statement Wednesday . <p> With the restriction in business operations during a lockdown , global manufacturing output further fell in the first two months of the year . <p> UN Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) reported to the CCSA that global industrial production indices in January declined to 103 and to 102.6 in February this year .

@@71905641 <h> Secretary Pompeo With Lars Larson of Lars Larson Show <p> QUESTION : Well , if there 's one guy who can get to the bottom of this , imagine a guy who served in the United States Congress , he served at the CIA , he served in the military , and he was a tank platoon leader , but he also went to Harvard . Now , that 's a great collection of background for a resume , and he is today the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo . <p> Secretary of State Pompeo , welcome to the program . <p> SECRETARY POMPEO : It 's great to be with you . It 's been too long . I hope you 're doing well . <p> QUESTION : Yeah , I 'm doing very well . It 's been a long time since you stood in my studio a long , long time ago . But I -- I want to ask you this first . I was just mentioning what we know and what we hope to know about what the Chinese involvement in this coronavirus , COVID , China virus , Wuhan virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lunar New Year , Christmas card list before this happened , and you 've been pretty tough on them since , have n't you ? <p> SECRETARY POMPEO : I prefer to think of it as just reflecting the challenges that they have presented to us . This is a -- we 've had now more than 50,000 people die in the United States , enormous economic harm to our country from a virus that originated in Wuhan , China . And we 've not yet been able to get access to the information that we need , the world has n't been able to get access to the information we need , to figure out how this happened , how it was the case that this got around the world that quickly when the Chinese Government clearly knew about this in December . <p> And then second , how do we get comfort that with all the labs that are inside of the Chinese country today that they 're operating those labs in a way that 's consistent with making sure this never happens again ? <p> Those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western scientists so we can make sure that their security levels and their management levels at these facilities does n't present the -- a risk that something like this could ever happen again . <p> QUESTION : In fact , did n't your folks on the ground about two years ago from State send cables back , I think in 2018 , saying , " Hey , they 're being kind of sloppy over at the Wuhan virus institute " ? <p> SECRETARY POMPEO : There have been long concerns based on a number of things , including the fact that this is -- this is a program that 's been concerning because they 've had leaks from their facilities before , back in -- I think it 's 2004 , 2005 . I might get the year wrong , but this is not the -- this is not something that we are conjecturing about . We 've had known problems , and we have been stiff-armed . And those who have tried to talk about this , whether it was doctors or journalists , those who have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so freely . That 's not cooperation . That 's not transparency . We want to do that . We want to work alongside the Chinese Government to get answers to these questions . But to do that , they 've got to share information , share data with the United States and with the world , and with the best scientists all over this world . <p> QUESTION : Mr. Secretary , you 'd actually like to see the United States get some direct access to actually put eyes on what 's going on inside that Wuhan virus institute . Is that right ? <p> SECRETARY POMPEO : We got to get to the bottom of it . The devastation wrought on the globe as a result of this is enormous , and it requires a real response to find the answers for this pandemic , and to prevent one from happening in the future . <p> QUESTION : I guess the thing that seems puzzling to me is when the Chinese knew apparently a week before they told their own population we have an epidemic , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the Lunar New Year celebrations , do n't go to that giant potluck in Wuhan with 50,000 families there , maybe more than 100,000 people going to a potluck , for God 's sake , as an epidemic is breaking out . The government knew it , they did n't decide to warn it . Did they think they could really keep this thing under wraps ? Because they must have imagined that at some point it would become an epidemic , the rest of the world would learn , and it would escape from their shores since they used to have tens of thousands of Chinese nationals coming into our country on a daily basis by airplane for a whole bunch of reasons . They must have known this could get out . How did they think they were going to play this to ( inaudible ) when we found out they knew ? <p> SECRETARY POMPEO : It 's an interesting question . I do n't know what they were thinking . I simply know what they did and what they failed to do , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I know President Trump and this administration 's responsibility , it 's our duty to figure out how that transpired and do everything we can to prevent something like this from happening again . <p> I 'm very confident that if we are permitted to have access to the information , locations , and all the data we need collectively -- not just the United States , but scientists from Europe and from Japan and from Australia , world 's leading scientists -- we can figure this thing out and we can reduce the risk that something like this would ever happen again . It 's been part of a global effort . It 's what the World Health Organization had the lead and responsibility to prevent from happening , and here we are . <p> QUESTION : I 'm talking to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo . Mr. Secretary , should the Chinese pay in some meaningful way for the damage they 've done to our country and to the rest of the world ? And if so , do you have any ideas of how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President , I think , has said this right . Our first focus is on making sure that we do everything we can to protect human life here in the States , and we get therapeutics and ultimately a vaccine as quickly as we possibly can , and we 're -- get our economy going back again . I talked to some friends back in Kansas just last week . They are chomping at the bit to get back at it . That 's mission one . We 've got to do that and we need to be singularly focused with respect to this virus about that . Then there will come a time to figure out what accountability ought to look like . <p> I am very convinced that the world knows what happened here , that they know this virus originated in Wuhan , and I 've already seen nations -- when I talk to my colleagues around the world , I 've already seen nations that are asking the same thing we are . The Australians have been great in demanding an investigation , other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectively recognize the shortcomings of this authoritarian regime and that there will be accountability for those who did things , whether they were simply reckless or negligent , that did things that resulted in the devastation to the global economy and to human life all around the world commensurate with the responsibility that they have for it . <p> QUESTION : Mr. Secretary , I want to shift gears a moment to Iran . You 've been having to fight against the UN trying to lift a ban on Iran 's purchase of advanced military technology . Is this even really a question , whether we should let the folks in Tehran buy advanced military technology ? <p> SECRETARY POMPEO : I hope not . Unfortunately , the previous administration , Secretary Kerry and President Obama , thought that October of 2021 was a -- excuse me , of 2020 , this year , a few months from now , was a perfectly good date on which the Iranian Government should be able to purchase conventional weapons systems from around the world . That was the date that was contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UN Security Council resolution gives us the ability to make sure that that does n't happen , and we are working with our Chinese , our Russian , our British , our French , our partners on the Security Council to make sure -- and even more broadly throughout the UN to make sure that they 're all on board in preventing this from happening coming October 18th of this year . <p> QUESTION : Mr. Secretary , I know as America 's top diplomat , you have to be diplomatic about this , but what in the world was the Obama administration thinking saying we 're going to take a state , a country , Iran , that was labeled by the United States as the top state sponsor of terrorism on the globe , and say it 's okay to let them start buying advanced bombs and bullets down -- just a few years down the road ? You have any insight to that ? <p> SECRETARY POMPEO : No explanation that is remotely reasonable there . They -- I think anyone who was staring at this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen just a handful of years after the deal was signed . We 've talked about this . The President talked about it as far back as his campaign about this crazy Iran nuclear deal , and one of the core failures of it was the fact that these provisions that prevented Iran from getting weapons that could do so much more destruction began to expire very quickly . <p> And here we are , as soon as 2020 , the first significant provision expiring , and we 've got Iran failing to comply with their nuclear elements -- their nuclear commitments under the JCPOA that we chose to withdraw from . This is a bad place that the world finds itself in , and your listeners should know President Trump and our team is going to make sure that when we come to October of this year , we 're going to have played every card in our kit to make sure that they ca n't purchase tanks and armored vehicles from Russia or from China . <p> QUESTION : Mr. Secretary , I know your time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go , but I want to ask one last question . One of the stories that has mystified a lot of us is that the National Institutes of Health -- let 's go back to Wuhan for a moment -- was actually putting money into some kind of program that was in Wuhan . Now I know that there are times where we cooperate with other countries or we have some involvement with other countries , maybe because it gives us a window into what they 're doing . But is there any good reason why American taxpayer dollars would be going to the Wuhan virus institute ? I know that 's a bit outside your lane , but I 'll bet you 've got a view on it . <p> SECRETARY POMPEO : So I do n't know the answer to precisely what happened there . I 've seen these reports as well where we collectively are trying to figure this out . I do know that there are places where we want to go , we want to see what they 're doing , we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nuclear assurance programs , where we help other countries make sure that they do n't lose a nuclear weapon or there 's not a nuclear accident , so we go in and try to assist them . <p> I assume that that 's what was taking place here . We were trying to help the Chinese make sure that they did n't have a problem , they were handling these materials in a way that would prevent accidental leakage or someone from stealing a pathogen or a virus , but I do n't know the answer to what was actually happening here . <p> QUESTION : Mr. Secretary , you 've come a long way since Kansas and being a tank platoon leader . Thank you very much for the time and I 'll look forward to the next time . <p> Well , unlike many news organisations , we have no sponsors , no corporate or ideological interests .

Older facilities , with the close proximity of residents , makes it much easier to transmit the virus . <p> " Now that we 're doing these mass swabbings , you get a resident or staff member that tests positive , they could have been coming to work for weeks without any symptoms , " Renaud said , noting that more tests mean the greater the chance for positive cases . " We 're starting to see some interesting results across the sector where we did n't expect to see . " <p> Renaud said both facilities went into immediate lockdown March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal times , and further educated staff about proper hand-washing and wearing of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . The programs team led by Leah McNain has also been instrumental in keeping the residents busy and active , from playing such things as hallway bingo to hallway hockey while showing physical distancing at the same time . <p> " Those things mattered , I think , " he said , saying staff has also been restricted to one site . Agency staff from Kitchener-Waterloo and London , usually needed to fulfill shifts , has also not been required of late , boosted a little by the early return of post-secondary students who have helped fill the void . <p> " Staffing has always been a challenge in this sector , but we 've been very fortunate . They 've all stuck with us through this and it 's certainly appreciated , " he said . <p> The fact that the leadership team has been visible through the pandemic and working seven-days a week right alongside everyone else has also helped with morale , Renaud noted , praising the Directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ritz Villa and Christina Moreno at MNH . <p> " We 've got a good team here , " he said . " Having the leadership team visibly on the floor has been tremendous , they other staff really appreciate that . We 're showing everyone that we 're in this together . " <p> The use of iPads for residents to talk to loved ones via FaceTime has gone up dramatically , along with window and balcony visits . <p> Now that the weather has improved , residents will also be able to get outside more but only within acceptable guidelines . <p> " Generally speaking the attitude is pretty good , " he said . <p> Renaud said there was an overwhelming response from the community when they found out that masks and PPE was needed , and it 's continued with various businesses randomly dropping off food or other supplies these past few weeks . <p> In the event of a positive case , isolation rooms have been built at both facilities ready for occupancy , along with enough N95 masks and other PPE . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we just tried to stay ahead of the curve , " he said . <p> In the future , Renaud can see changes made in long-term care facilities including the wearing of masks and screening of staff , residents and visitors as common practice . Currently , screens are being done at the front door from 5:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily when staff begin their shift , and again when they leave . Residents are also screened regularly . <p> " There is no end in sight . Out in the community you can say they 've reached our peak but there are more cases and more homes that are getting hit and it 's really impacting this sector really negatively , " he said . " While we think that most of society is getting back to some sort of normalcy maybe by the end of May , and we 'll start to open up the economy , you ca n't say the same thing for long-term care .

@@51672441 <p> It 's a buzz phrase that 's been tossed around regarding mapping people 's contacts with each other using smartphones in order to be aware of those infected with COVID-19 and those with whom they have been in contact . <p> But , like much of what has been happening since pandemic restrictions were introduced worldwide , contact tracing comes with some privacy concerns . <p> While he did n't address the concept of technological tracing May 6 , Premier John Horgan did discuss contact tracing . <p> And , said B.C. Information and Privacy Commissioner Michael McEvoy , the issue has been under discussion with the Ministry of Health and provincial chief health officer Bonnie Henry . <p> " I think there may be a place for contact tracing as the province takes the next steps in addressing COVID-19 , " McEvoy told Glacier Media . <p> " Any information would be voluntarily collected , " McEvoy said . " It would only be used for one purpose and that 's for fighting COVID-19 . " <p> But , McEvoy said , if such technology is to be used , the province needs the trust of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not a magic bullet , " McEvoy stressed . " It 's just one more tool public health could use to assist in their efforts if it 's done properly . " <p> McEvoy and his federal , territorial and provincial counterparts issued a statement to Canadians on the issue May 7 , saying some apps " do not provide an effective level of protection suited to the digital environment . " <p> The use of contact tracing is not unknown in recent disease history , having been used in the early days of HIV/AIDS . <p> It did lead , though , to the purported identification of a Vancouver man , Ga ? tan Dugas , who became known but misdescribed as Patient Zero ( more from a misread of the letter ' O ' than anything ) . He was later found to be one of many people infected in the 1970s . <p> That , however , was the early 1980s and involved a lot of research and detective work . <p> In contrast , technological tools can now make light work of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being touted as a quick way to alert people about possible contact . <p> The UK , South Korea , Australia and Singapore already employ apps . <p> Indeed , McEvoy said he has been in contact with his Singapore counterpart and learned the participation rate is only about 20% . McEvoy said his research indicates a need for 50-70% of the population participating for effective traction . Further , he said , as not all people use smartphones , that number may be 60-80% . <p> Federal Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam has said contact tracing is an " absolutely critical " public health measure as Canada moves forward in confronting COVID-19 . Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has touted it as a tool while noting privacy issues must be addressed . <p> However , the Canadian Civil Liberties Association ( CCLA ) in an April 20 letter fired a shot across Trudeau 's bows . <p> While saying technology can support public health efforts , the CCLA told Trudeau , " Involuntary collection of information by governments remains unwarranted today and any requests for voluntary participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be suspended for proposed public surveillance . " <p> The CCLA said before such tools are used , certain factors must be engaged : <p> * the jurisdiction 's privacy commissioner must be engaged prior to and during implementation of any public health surveillance measures ; <p> * data collection must be grounded in evidence of public health necessity , pursuant to a chief medical officer data ' warrant ; <p> * there must be a compelling objective for the data surveillance ; <p> * an impact detriment analysis for the vulnerable must accompany any executive order , but particularly one involving surveillance , with input from human rights commissions ; <p> * a firewall must protect public health data for public health purposes from police and public order officials and data must be destroyed at the end of an emergency ; <p> * there must be a time limit on data collection ; <p> * chief public health officers and chief legal officers must appear before a legislative committee ( online or otherwise ) as witnesses for questioning by legislative members prior to the implementation of surveillance measures ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementation must exist to oversee the process , receive public complaints , provide recourse for rights infringement and regularly report to the public as to their observations and the nature and number of complaints received . <p> McEvoy said there are several models of tools available . Singapore 's , he said , is similar to those used in Alberta and Australia . Phone apps collect data from close contacts . If you test positive , a public health officer then uses the app to trace your contacts to alert them to be tested . <p> China , McEvoy said , does location tracking with its technology . <p> " That 's obviously a place nobody would want to go , " he said . <p> Another model is the Google-Apple approach where users testing positive " press a button " on their phone and it messages contacts to get tested . There , the government does n't get the information , McEvoy said . <p> Alberta using app <p> Alberta recently released the ABTraceTogether app , which the provincial government says " uses a secure , community-driven approach where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the app installed is detected nearby . No other information is shared . " <p> If a person tests positive , they would be asked who they had been in contact with in the past 21 days . If the person has the app , they would be asked to voluntarily upload the encrypted data from the app to Alberta Health Services ( AHS ) . " <p> " Once AHS receives the encrypted data , AHS contact tracers will be able to use that information to reach the other app users who have had close contact with the infected person , " a government website said . <p> The only personal data AHS collects in set-up is a user 's mobile number to allow fast contact in case of close proximity to a COVID-19 case , the website said . Geolocation data is not stored and Bluetooth log data is secure until shared . If the app is deleted , all data remains for 21 days . <p> Public Health Ontario has also been working on such a tool . <p> Early on in the pandemic , civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app use . <p> " People in Canada are concerned about the possibility of invasive emergency measures and for their potential to continue undermining our rights after the current crisis is over , " the statement said . " Even in times of crisis , mass digital surveillance tools pose a unique and insidious threat to our fundamental values . <p> " There is also a real risk that they undermine public health measures by providing a false sense of security , or undermine trust in and disclosure to public institutions . It is therefore crucial that all discussions about enhanced surveillance take place transparently and openly , before any new measures are put in place . " <p> Among those groups was B.C. 's Freedom of Information and Privacy Association ( FIPA ) . Executive director Jason Woywada said FIPA is pleased B.C. has not rushed into a contact tracing app . <p> " We have seen the implications of ' surveillance-as-solution ' thinking elsewhere and previously in our own history , " Woywada said . " We think it is important to highlight that these apps be approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consideration before implementation to ensure they are protecting people 's privacy and are not inappropriately collecting , using , disclosing or retaining information . <p> " There remains a great deal of debate on whether these surveillance apps lead to improved outcomes in comparison to more general public health awareness of relevant practises like hand washing and physical distancing . " <p> The B.C. Civil Liberties Association was also a signatory . <p> Policy director Aisha Weaver said the association is pleased with what the commissioners have produced . She said if governments allow private actors to collect data then oversight mechanisms are vital . <p> But , she said , the technology has its limitations given Bluetooth linkages might not properly reflect locations if people are on a street near a closed car , on differing sides of walls or in enclosed spaces . <p> She noted there have been calls for de-identification or anonymizing of such data , something she said adds a further complication to the equation . <p> Calgary lawyer privacy and technology Kristal Allen said such tracing is an alternative to resource-intensive manual tracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having one 's interactions with others and movements within society traced understandably gives rise to a variety of privacy and security concerns , and fears regarding intrusive surveillance .

@@51672241 <p> Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , and welcome to the Endurance International Group 2020 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call . ( Operator Instructions ) As a reminder , this conference call is being recorded . I would now like to turn the conference over to your host , Ms. Angela White , VP of Investor Relations . <p> Thanks , Ashley . Good morning , everyone . It 's my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2020 earnings call . First , we 'll go through some prepared remarks , after which we 'll turn to Q&amp;A . We prepared a presentation to accompany our comments , which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.endurance.com . While not necessary to follow along , we recommend referencing the presentation slides alongside our prepared remarks . As is customary , let me now read the safe harbor statement . Statements made on today 's call will include forward-looking statements about Endurance 's future expectations , plans and prospects . All such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties . Please refer to the cautionary language in today 's earnings release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 14 , 2020 , for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements . Endurance does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements . During the call , we 'll reference several non-GAAP financial measures , including adjusted EBITDA , free cash flow , net debt and bank-adjusted EBITDA . A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on the presentation located in the IR section of our website . With that , I 'll turn the call over to Jeff Fox , our President and CEO . <p> Thank you , Angela , and good morning . I am pleased with the results we delivered and the continued progress we made in the first quarter . Obviously , no one anticipated the impact COVID-19 is having globally on all aspects of people 's lives , livelihoods and business operations . Since the pandemic accelerated in early March , we have operated with 3 guiding principles to help our organization remain focused and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to focus on the safety of our employees and their family members as our top priority . By the third week of March , we had all of our teams in a work-from-home model , and I could not be more proud of the way the team executed this unplanned move with minimal disruption to our business and our customers . Second , we are fortunate to hold a position as a scale provider of digital marketing and web presence solutions in a large and growing market . We continue to see secular demand for our services , and we 'll continue to invest in delivering competitively priced solutions that help our customers achieve their objectives . Finally , we have a valuable set of assets and provide services to approximately 5 million customers . We have made considerable progress executing our strategy to invest in our market-leading strategic brands , to simplify our operational complexity and to integrate our teams as we drive scale . We remain focused on investing to grow both of our scale business segments . Through April , our execution has remained consistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is too early to predict the extent of the pandemic 's effect on our business for the remainder of the year . As such , we believe it 's prudent to suspend our previously provided guidance for 2020 as we focus on delivering value to our customers and executing our plan . Marc will discuss this in more detail in his section . <p> Turning now to Slide 6 . Our GAAP revenue in the first quarter was $272.2 million . Revenue in our digital marketing segment reflected year-over-year growth when adjusting for the December 2019 sale of SinglePlatform . Our web presence segment continued to make progress toward revenue inflection by delivering another quarter of net unit growth . We ended the quarter with 4.78 million subscribers on platform , which marks our third consecutive quarter of net subscriber growth when adjusting for the sale of SinglePlatform , adding 14,000 net new subs . <p> Adjusted EBITDA was $72.5 million , which is down from $76.9 million in Q1 of 2019 , adjusted for the sale of SinglePlatform . Year-over-year , we increased investment in our product , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost increase . And we are pleased with the progress we made on our strategic brands . Year-to-date , we repurchased approximately 8.7 million shares of our stock for a total of $14.4 million at an average price per share of $1.66 . Our Board authorization remains in place with remaining capacity of $25.5 million . <p> Turning now to Slide 7 . Before we go into our segment details , it 's important to note the progress we have made , operationalizing our 2 scale strategic platforms . As a reminder , we changed our reporting to reflect our simplified organization and the teams in both businesses executed their plans in the first quarter . <p> Turning now to Slide 8 . In our digital marketing segment , we continue to make progress transforming constant contact from an e-mail marketing point solution into a digital marketing brand with significantly expanded solutions . During the quarter , we increased revenue year-over-year by $2.2 million and are pleased with the net subscriber growth we delivered . Operationally , our sales , support , marketing and engineering teams executed very effectively with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we made progress enhancing our core e-mail platform , integrating our recently acquired Ecomdash business and enhancing our website builder , logo and e-commerce capabilities under the Constant Contact brand . In addition , in response to COVID-19 , we launched the Constant Contact Small Business Support Kit , which provides action plans and guidance by industry to SMB customers looking for helpful resources as they navigate this crisis . We are pleased with the team 's effort in launching this dedicated site , which is part of our long-term strategy to deliver capabilities that complement our high-value e-mail marketing solution . <p> Turning now to our web presence segment . Our results reflect continued revenue stabilization in our third consecutive quarter of positive net unit growth . The team delivered these results by successfully executing our growth plan on our strategic brands , complemented by excellent work by our teams in Latin America , India and Holland . As a scale web presence solution provider , we add over 1 million new customers on an annual basis . Our 2020 plan remains unchanged and is focused on expanding our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosting and domain products . In Q1 , our web presence teams did an excellent job pivoting quickly to address the COVID-related challenges . Our global support centers continue to serve customers 24/7 despite the complexities of moving agents to work-from-home status . From a marketing perspective , we also launched portals across key brands aimed at providing toolkits to help customers navigate through this disruptive period . <p> Turning now to Slide 10 . In Q1 , we continue to make progress positioning our strategic brands for long-term growth as we navigated challenges introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic . We are pleased with the execution by our brand and platform teams and are investing to grow our business by delivering increased value to customers . <p> With that , I 'll turn the call over to Marc Montagner to discuss our financial results in more detail . <p> Thank you , Jeff . On Slide 12 , I am pleased to review our first quarter 2020 results . On a reported basis , GAAP revenue was $272.2 million ; adjusted EBITDA was $72.5 million ; free cash flow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finance equipment , was $23.7 million . Please note that in the same period a year ago , revenue and adjusted EBITDA contribution from SinglePlatform was $7 million and $1.6 million , respectively . The sale of SinglePlatform occurred in December 2019 . Normalizing for these numbers , revenue in the same period a year ago would have been $273.7 million and adjusted EBITDA $76.9 million . Our year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA was due mostly to increased level in investment in engineering and increased sales and marketing expenses . This was primarily offset by benefits from lower support costs . GAAP cash flow from operation in the first quarter was $34.9 million . CapEx was $11.2 million and free cash flow was $23.7 million . The year-over-year increases in cash flow from operations and free cash flow were mostly impacted by the timing of payroll in the first quarter of ' 19 , a onetime funding of a security class action settlement in the first quarter of ' 19 and no bonus payment in the first quarter of 2020 . Additionally , in the first quarter of 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to higher cash collections . <p> Slide 13 . We finished the first quarter of 2020 with 4.780 million subscribers approximately . Net subscriber additions for the first quarter were approximately 14,000 positive . We are very pleased to see another quarter of positive subscriber addition . In the first quarter of 2020 , combined avenue -- average revenue per subscriber or ARPS , was $19.01 . In web presence , it was $13.50 ; and digital marketing , $69.50 . <p> Slide 14 . We ended the first quarter with $1.713 billion in total senior debt . Including other deferred purchase obligation and capital leases of $9 million and total cash on the balance sheet of $114 million , total net debt at the end of the period was $1.608 billion . During the first quarter , we paid down approximately $8 million of the principal on our term-loan debt . Our LTM bank adjusted EBITDA for the period ended March 31 , was $310.9 million . Our senior debt leverage ratio was 4.06x and remains well below our maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 6x . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are suspending our guidance for 2020 . We will still focus on executing our original plan , but given the nature of our business , it 's still too early to assess impact of this pandemic on a customer base of approximately 5 million subscribers . As of today , demand for our product and services is consistent with our 2020 growth plan , but we 're closely monitoring the effectiveness of program marketing spend and watching our churn rate . We 're also taking a prudent financial approach and are paying very close attention to our expenses . The new CARES Act will have a positive impact on our free cash flow in 2020 . We will be able to defer to 2021 and 2022 approximately $10 million FICA taxes . In addition , we will benefit from a temporary increase in federal tax deduction from our cash interest payment in 2019 and 2020 . This will reduce our federal taxes by approximately $5 million in 2020 and also increase our NOL balance at the end of 2019 by approximately $50 million . Year-to-date , we repurchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an average price per share of $1.66 . The bulk of these purchases occurred in the first quarter . We also repurchased $3 million of high note at an average discount of approximately 5% in the first quarter . <p> We ended the quarter with $114 million of cash on the balance sheet and are managing our use of cash prudently given the end nodes . We also have access to $165 million revolving credit facility which is undrawn . We do not face any significant debt maturity in the near term . We feel very comfortable with our liquidity position at this time . <p> Thanks , Marc . I 'm proud of the work the team is doing , and we are pleased with our year-to-date results . The team is operating at scale with focus on customer value and enhancing our ability to serve more customers more effectively on a daily basis . Despite the global uncertainty , we will continue to execute our plan to grow our business by investing in sales , marketing , product and engineering on our valuable strategic brands . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , stay healthy . <p> Thank you for joining us this morning . Now I 'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&amp;A . <p> Just a couple of questions on my end . So of the 11,000 subscribers you guys added in presence , can you give us some more color on , are these customers are coming for domains ? Or what kind of attach rate you might be seeing to other offerings there ? And then some of your peers came out talking about trends and giving us an update about what they 're seeing . And it seems like there might be some kind of a pickup in new customer demand from people kind of trying to set up businesses from home and also some incremental pickup in cancellations . So just curious to know what you might be seeing on your end ? <p> So we do n't really go into the details on the first question . I think we 've tried , Naved , to be real clear that we see an expanded solution opportunity on the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HostGator and Constant Contact as the primary , and so we 're not going to separate out and start reporting on specific attach rates . We feel like that would be just too much granularity . And we would never be able to do that from an SEC or reporting perspective . Our general plan , which I was speaking about is we see the opportunity to take the units we 're bringing in and through the year continue to improve that user experience and the specificity of solutions that these users need to accomplish their objectives and whether it 's domains or hosting or e-mail marketing , our plan for the rest of the year is to keep investing to deliver additional solutions . <p> On your second question , we 're seeing the same thing . I mean the Google Search trends would tell you that short term there 's secular demand . I 've tried to keep it simple for us because we look at it , and we believe that we have a secular demand tailwind that should help us . But I think we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this health care situation plays out . And therefore , how society gets to functioning again and how things have or have not changed in terms of what 's -- of who 's going to go back in the business or how they 're going to do business . So we 're not in disagreement with anything that our peers have said . I feel like we see the same trends . And what -- I think Marc referenced , how closely we 're watching our cash , our expenses and our -- the value of the units we 're acquiring , and what 's happening within our subscriber base . And so we 're watching it very carefully . And staying focused on the investments we think are right for the long-term opportunity to grow . <p> That 's helpful . And maybe a quick follow-up . On the Constant Contact side of things , I understand it 's a slightly higher ARPS . Are you seeing greater usage for this product as businesses try to stay in touch with their customers ? Or are you seeing more pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends to call out on that side ? <p> Yes . So we definitely have seen our platform used more , which we 're encouraged by , right ? So just a reminder , right , for those who really do n't follow the industry , e-mail marketing is a very high return on investment marketing solution . And it 's -- we 've been doing it for 20 years . We were actually -- one could argue , we were actually the first really big player training people on e-mail marketing . And so , Naved , it 's a great question . It 's a great call out . We did see the customers we have using our platform more . I mean , obviously , not all of them , but we saw very much increased usage , which is logical , given the complexity of the pandemic and how it came on and how much people needed to communicate and will need to communicate . So we 're very pleased with that . We 're glad we 've been investing in that platform . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really simple , right , which is we need to grow our net customers , and we need to grow the value those customers get over time . And those are -- I -- we 're not -- we do n't report on the difference between gross and net in any of our businesses , just to avoid the complexity of micro-disclosure for us . So we 're very pleased with the quarter we had in our e-mail marketing segment and feel like there 's a lot more we can do over time with some of the investments we 're making and intend to make . <p> This is John Byun for Brent Thill . Just want to follow-up on the previous question . Is there any other color maybe you could share on what 's going on since late March through April in terms of customer behavior , products that seem to be more in demand or we 're seeing more interest ? Anything that 's kind of different than what you had seen previously ? And then I have a follow-up . <p> So I 'll defer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks are -- I mean we think folks are using tools and have time to use these tools . And so we think this has been a net benefit for anybody that supplies anything we do , whether it 's just buying a domain , buying a domain and hooking up G Suite or Office 365 or just a lower priced e-mail-only solution , right ? We see people figuring out you really need to do these things . We 've definitely seen the mainstream folks have to get very creative with marketing , inventory management , potentially listing on multiple marketplaces . So we 're seeing a pull-forward because of the crisis , of the exploration and utilization of tools and capabilities that we provide , along with a lot of other folks , right ? So when I say secular demand , that 's what we 're describing . The specificity of it , we definitely think there 's been more demand for some things that we 're not as exposed to but it 's -- what you would hear from us is that we 're working really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a domain customer , a web hosting customer or an e-mail marketing customer . Those are our 3 primary exposures , but our whole investment strategy on our strategic brands has been to be able to take people that join us with their first purchase being one of those brands and make sure that they can do more things like e-commerce , build a website , post on Facebook or a list you integrate on Facebook , pull down their Shopify data and manage multi-marketplace listings or Ecomdash solutions . So I 'm elaborating a little bit to just make sure you know that we know where we make our money . We feel like secular demand is a good thing . We feel like we 're trying to increase , in 2020 , our exposure to things beyond just our core capabilities . And that 's our holistic strategy that we 're executing . <p> Appreciate the color there . And then just a quick follow-up on the ARPS for the web presence side that is down again . Is there any dynamic behind it ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends in ARPS for web presence ? <p> No . It 's the accumulated effect of some high and low value customers that are trading on legacy brands versus this or that . But we 're not managing to an ARPS number on either side of our business . We 're managing to customer success and a good return on our cost to acquire and a building lifetime revenue strategy . So we 're -- it 's a result , it 's not the number we 're managing to . We intend to grow our units -- our strategy is to grow our units , grow our revenue and grow our profitability because we feel like we have an aggregate scale , profitable exposure to growing markets .

To my mind , there 's nothing better suited to the day than a review of National Income Accounts and Gross Domestic Product . Of course , Covid-19 and its urgent effects upon both will animate this column . <p> In times like these , economists and many others watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is typically the annualized change in Gross Domestic Product over the last quarter . Not surprisingly , these most recent data were ugly , reporting that GDP dropped by 4.8 percent at an annualized rate . That means the measured economy in March was about 1.2 percent lower than in December after adjusting for seasonal differences . But what does this tell us about what is happening in our economy ? <p> The answer is less than we should hope for . Our GDP fails to count most of those things we do at home , for which money is not transacted . As we grow more affluent and can better exploit the division of labor , GDP naturally rises . A century ago , when a much larger share of Americans grew or raised their own food and cooked it , cut one another 's hair and made their own clothes , measured GDP per person was much lower . Even accounting for inflation , we have a higher GDP today than a century ago , simply because we count more types of exchange . <p> Obviously , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our lives . Barbering is better now than a century ago , as are options for lawn care , medicine or transportation . As Adam Smith explained in 1775 , this simple act of getting really good at one task is productivity improving . It grows GDP , not just because we count it , but because we are better at it . Still , we do much at home that is not measured as part of our economy , but failing to measure it does not mean it does n't happen . Recent events give us just such an example . <p> There are roughly 330 million Americans who eat three or so meals per day . I have two teenage boys at home , so we average roughly four meals per day . On average , close to one million meals are consumed by Americans each day , with about 20 percent consumed at restaurants . The restaurant industry is about $800 billion in sales , or roughly $200 per month for the average American . <p> Over the past month and a half , most U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know how many meals are still consumed each week from carry out . Still , it is safe to say that American families are making well over 100 million more meals at home each day than they were two months ago . This has a big impact on measured GDP . We continue to count the value of the groceries that goes into these meals , but that is a small share of it total value . We fail to count the value of the meal preparation in our official statistics . <p> The Covid-19 crisis causes a small but not trivial share of measured GDP to disappear as it is done at home . Meal preparation is the obvious example , but all kinds of other personal services from personal trainers , home cleaning , laundry services , dog walkers , haircuts and the like simply disappear from the official measures . This is not because the services are n't being performed , but because they are n't measured . <p> Perhaps we should measure these activities better , but I 'm not sure how important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to inform responsive economic policy . We have a pretty good idea of damages right now without measuring the value of home production . Moreover , it is hard enough to make a good accounting of how much I spend at restaurants and personal services . Imagine the difficulty of placing a dollar value me walking my own dog ? <p> What we are more likely to do during this crisis and in the years ahead is to re-evaluate how we individually value these unmeasured parts of GDP . I suspect this will cause us to change how and where we consume goods , not just during this Covid-19 crisis , but long afterwards . One early indicator of that will be meals eaten at home in the months after this crisis recedes . Of course there 'll be a big spike in restaurant sales as Americans head to their favorite watering holes and diners . But , after a few weeks , we might see a return to home cooked meals . <p> Large consumption changes such as this have consequences . Obviously , this would be unwelcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who rely on food and beverage taxes . This would also affect grocery stores , and the types of food they buy . Restaurants are better consumers of locally produced food than many groceries , so these changes affect farms and produce providers as well . <p> These changes also affect families . Meals consumed at home provide more intense family time than many other settings . Some families will find this beneficial , and continue the ritual for that purpose as well . Eating at home is less expensive in measured dollars , but requires labor inputs not measured . I write about these matters in the shadow of Mother 's Day . That is appropriate , because a disproportionate share of unmeasured work falls to women , particularly those who happen to have kids . <p> Maybe this crisis will cause some adjustments in homebound economics . Perhaps we 'll have kids who learn to cook or assist at meals , and maybe gain a more enduring appreciation for those skills . Maybe we will see a shift in the gendered division of labor at home . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , which could jump start some equalization of tasks performed at home . <p> All of these will be interesting develops to watch for and talk about at those meals we spend together . In a generation , when children who are not yet born hear about these times , they will doubtless ask questions about these issues . We will face the same sorts of questions those who lived through the Great Depression or World War II were asked . Whatever else our answers to these questions , I hope that we can all say that we did something to make this a memorable Mother 's Day , even if you ca n't give your mom a hug . <p> Michael Hicks is the George and Frances Ball Distinguished Professor of Economics and the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University .

@@71897241 <h> ( FILE PHOTO ) <p> ( CNN ) -- As the need for widespread COVID-19 testing grows , officials are looking to flush out hidden cases of the virus by examining sewage . <p> Groups of scientists around the world are using wastewater testing as a non-invasive way to measure the prevalence of coronavirus in their communities . <p> Local governments in the US are also turning to the tests , which detect traces of coronavirus genetic material -- known as RNA -- in fecal matter . <p> The data can be used to gain a sense of how many people may have had the virus asymptomatically and are passing it through , in addition to those testing positive because they are outwardly sick , New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer told CNN . <p> His county in Delaware has partnered with Biobot -- an MIT-based startup -- to screen wastewater for coronavirus . Biobot is testing sewage in 150 facilities across 30 states , according to a company spokeswoman . <p> New Castle County just completed its first week of testing and expects to have results early this week , Meyer said . In its pilot 24-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Castle County alone . Those results would far outpace the 4,034 estimated number of confirmed cases in the state , according to Johns Hopkins University data . <p> " We 're confident as we do this weekly , now that we 're working with Biobot , that this can give a varying indication of the total number of cases in our county , which is somewhat useful , " Meyer said . " We want to identify hotspots , run this at 10 treatment facilities across a county of 560,000 people , and find out with these hotspots where they are and where they 're not . " <p> Meyer said he has spoken with state officials about implementing wastewater testing across the state -- though he said he 's been met with some skepticism . <h> ' Early warning system ' <p> Meanwhile , in the Syracuse area of New York , four professors across three universities have partnered up to test Onondaga County wastewater using a centrifugal process to isolate the virus -- a process they say could significantly speed up detection of Covid-19 outbreaks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , told CNN he organized the project after coming across a paper showing that scientists in the Netherlands had successfully performed a wastewater test for Covid-19 . <p> Larsen said he recruited his colleague Teng Zeng in Syracuse 's engineering department to collaborate with wastewater facilities in Onondaga County . Samples were then sent to Hyatt Green and Frank Middleton , both of whom are part of the State University of New York ( SUNY ) system . <p> Middleton , a professor at SUNY Upstate Medical University , said the isolation process they have devised adheres RNA samples of Covid-19 in wastewater to polyethylene glycol , a resin that destroys the active virus and concentrates into a pellet . <p> The pellet is then tested through a process known as polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The PCR is used to detect Covid-19 specifically , as opposed to other viruses that may have found their way into the testing samples , Middleton said . <p> He estimated that in the group 's academic lab , they could test up to 100 samples a day , though if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many as 1,500 tests daily . <p> " This is unlike anything that I 've done in the past , " Middleton , who serves as the director of the SUNY Molecular Analysis Core , said . " We can do that PCR almost instantaneously , after we have the pellet . About 12 minutes later -- by lab standards , it 's almost instantaneous -- ( we have the results ) . " <p> Green , a microbiologist at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry , said the entire testing process would most likely take close to four to eight hours because of what 's entailed in actually collecting and filtering out the wastewater samples . <p> But he said the difference in hours of testing for Covid-19 presence regularly -- compared to testing only symptomatic patients when there are spikes in cases -- could be a major deterrent in reducing hotspots both now and in a potential second wave . <p> " In some areas , it 's not practical , " Green said . " But in a lot of areas , it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can crank it up at the beginning when you first hear about the possibility of an outbreak , you can use the platform as an early warning system . That would give us days or weeks lead time in coping with the pandemic or epidemic . " <h> Testing overseas <p> Scientists in other countries have also been using their sewerage systems to mass test for Covid-19 , though they express caution on how accurately wastewater samples reflect community levels of the virus . <p> In early April , the journal Nature reported that more than a dozen research groups around the world were analyzing wastewater for Covid-19 , with traces of the virus found in wastewater in the US , Netherlands and Sweden . <p> The Netherlands ' National Institute for Public Health and the Environment said in a statement last month that coronavirus had been detected in a wastewater sample taken four days after the country 's first confirmed case . <p> " A small percentage of patients with Covid-19 have the novel coronavirus in their gastrointestinal tract , and thus excrete it in their faeces , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 . <p> The wastewater testing approach had previously been used to detect viruses such as polio and measles , the statement said . <p> The Italian Institute for Health ( ISS ) reported last week that wastewater samples had returned positive results for parts of Milan and Rome . It said the RNA that was detected did not necessarily represent live , infectious virus . <p> " The result reinforces the prospects of using urban center sewage control as a non-invasive tool for early detection of infections in the population , " the ISS said in a statement . " In Phase 2 , surveillance can be used to indirectly monitor the circulation of the virus and to early detect its possible reappearance , thus allowing to recognize and circumscribe any new epidemic outbreaks more quickly . " <p> Australian researchers have also found traces of the virus in sewage and said they are working towards a national testing program . <p> " The hope is eventually we will be able to not just detect the geographic regions where Covid-19 is present , but the approximate number of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the head of Australia 's national science agency -- CSIRO -- said in a statement issued on April 16 . " This will give the public a better sense of how well we are containing this pandemic . " <p> In neighboring New Zealand , scientists at the state-owned ESR said they are testing wastewater for Covid-19 to try to gauge the effectiveness of eradication efforts and better understand the patterns of community transmission . <p> " We 're collaborating with research organizations here and internationally and contributing to the global effort to learn more about Coronavirus and ultimately find a vaccination , " said ESR Chief Scientist Brett Cowan in a statement earlier this month . <p> But the ESR researchers noted that Covid-19 was a respiratory illness and " unlikely to be spread by contaminated faeces , " suggesting levels of the virus would be low and hard to detect .

@@84836741 <h> Will Gold Decline As Economies Gradually Reopen ? <p> Half the US States and countries like Italy and Germany are gradually easing lockdowns . Taking measured steps , the moves are broadly cheered . Rightfully so ? And what does the reopening mean for the gold market ? <h> Epidemics : Bad , Good , and Ugly <p> By May 6 , 2020 , more than total 3.6 million of confirmed cases have been reported in the world and more than 250,000 have already died from the COVID-19 . In the United States , about 1.2 million of cases have been identified so far , and more than 71,000 people have died . This is bad news . <p> What is good is that the US epidemiological curve has flattened somewhat , which means that the growth pace of infections and deaths , has slowed down . As the charts below shows , the peaks in daily number of both confirmed cases and deaths are beyond us . <p> Chart 1 : Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases ( rolling 3-day average ) in the US from February to May 6 , 2020 <p> Chart 2 : Daily confirmed COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February to May 6 , 2020 <p> This is really great news , as it means that social distancing worked and we avoided the continuation of the exponential growth . However , the ugly truth is that the epidemic is far from over . As the chart below shows , the US epidemiological curve still remains steeper than for other countries . Indeed , its trajectory does not look still like the curve for China where the epidemic is practically over . <p> Chart 3 : Daily confirmed cases per million people in the US compared to China and other countries . <p> And what is really disturbing is that the virus is mutating -- the new study published by researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory found that the coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan , China , has mutated and the new , dominant and even more contagious strain is spreading across the U.S. So , it goes without saying that the virus can mutate further and arrive in autumn as an even more ( or less , this is also possible ) deadly slash contagious pathogen . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the epidemic stabilizing , several European countries and more than a few US states are easing lockdowns . This is great news from the economic point of view . It was clear that economic shutdown could not last forever . However , this move is not without risks . The epidemiologists warn against the possibility of the second wave of infections in autumn , especially unless testing for the virus is expanded dramatically , which has not been done everywhere . Remember the Spanish flu ? It attacked in three waves . And do you know why ? Because many regions eased the restrictions too soon . We hope that the coronavirus will not return later this year , but , unfortunately , this is a possible scenario given the fact that we have not probably reached herd immunity yet . <h> Implications for Gold <p> What does the reopening of economies mean for the gold market ? Given that the Great Lockdown took gold prices to about $1,700 , does it imply that the Great Reopening will push gold down ? Well , not necessarily . <p> Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been priced into gold prices , the easing of lockdown restrictions could spur optimism and diminish gold 's safe-have appeal . The recent breaking news that the German high court has challenged the European Central Bank 's bond-buying authority has already weakened the euro against the US dollar , which can create downward pressure on the gold prices . And in our Gold Trading Alerts , we have warned Readers that , based on technical factors ( e.g. , the speculative interest in the gold market is very high ) , gold could go lower in the short-term , before it would go much higher . <p> However , investors should remember that the restrictions will be eased only gradually . And we could see second waves , at least in some places . And social distancing will not disappear during one night , so the economic recovery could be less vigorous than many people hope for .

Wash your hands and surface regularly . <p> Do n't touch or mingle with infected persons and surfaces . <p> Listen to doctors and nobody else and obey their orders . <p> Total lockdown <p> Let us look at the first and most draconian measure of the lockdown of all borders and entries which is generally accepted and regarded as a most effective measure to put a halt to the spread because it stagnates the virus in the affected community and thus containing the damage in one place which subsequently kills the infected people and saves the world or the infected eventually survive the virus and reunite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Prophet Muhammad had not witnessed a plaque in his life but still provided his containing measures , that in itself is a point to reckon with . <p> The Prophet Muhammad had provided this measure in the collection of Bukhari and Muslim which reads as follows- <p> Sa 'd reported : The Prophet , peace , and blessings be upon him , said , " If you hear of a plague in a land , then do not go into it . If it happens in land where you are , then do not go out of it . " <p> Source : S ? ah ? i ? h ? al-Bukha ? ri ? 5396 , S ? ah ? i ? h ? Muslim 2218 . <p> In another narration , it reads- <p> Aisha reported : She asked the Messenger of Allah , peace , and blessings be upon him , about plagues and he said , " It is a punishment that Allah sends upon whomever he wills , but Allah has made it mercy for the believers .

Abu Dawud , Thirmizi , ibn Majah . Ibn Hibban 5521 . <p> Aisha narrated that the Messenger of Allah peace be upon him , if he wanted to eat or drink , he would first wash his hands and then eat or drink . <p> Nasa'i 258- <p> Plus general instructions for Muslims to wash their hands in ablutions 15 times a day and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forth . <p> Do not touch or mingle with infected persons and surfaces . <p> Quran has subtly shed light on the fact that it is quite possible to contract a disease or virus by touching or mingling with an infected person or surface . This could be found in chapter 20 vs 97 where it says ( go away and say throughout your life no touching ) . Qurdubi has reported in his book Aljami li Ahkamil Quran , that Samiri was banished and was ordered to tell anyone that comes his way that ' no touching ' . According to Qurdubi anyone that touches him develops fever and shivering in his body . This serves as a clear indication that disease or ailment could be transmitted by touching a substance . <p> The Prophet of Allah said- <p> ' Runaway from a leper like you run away from a lion . Bukhari <p> Do not mix the infected camels with sound ones . Bukhari <p> It was narrated by as-Shareed ibn Suwayd ath-Thaqafi , who said , " Among the delegation from Thaqeef there was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allah be upon him ) sent word to him , saying , ' We have accepted your oath of allegiance , so go back . ' " Narrated by Muslim <p> The aim of these warnings is to limit body contact to the barest minimum with the infected persons and surfaces and to create awareness that disease could be possibly transmitted in the process . Based on these teachings , as reported by Ibn Al Athir in his book Alkamil fittarikh , Muslims were able to eradicate the first plaque that hit them- Amwas plaque -after the Prophet peace be upon him by evacuating people out of town to an open field and creating isolation centers where the infected people that showed any symptoms were isolated and separated from the healthy ones until their demise or survival . <p> Listen to doctors and nobody else and obey their orders . <p> Quran says ' Ask the expert on whatever you have no knowledge of .

And that is why as reported by Muslims when the messenger of Allah was told that date trees are yielding fewer fruits in Medina he asked them to go and meet the experts . He said you know better about your world ! The situation does not need invoking miraculous action but doing the practical things that will stand the test of time , " always consult the expert " . <p> Doctors are the experts in this crisis and thus all Muslim clerics and the general public should heed their advice and abide by it .

I do n't think the house has ever had so much work done to it ! <p> " My dad and step-mum are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shopping and helping them out . <p> " I think the hardest part for me is not being able to hug my son , who lives nearby . It 's so difficult just not being able to be close to people . <p> " Thank god for Facetime , I 've got to say . It 's kept me going , being able to see my friends and speak with them . <p> " The street has been really helpful , too , we 're all there for each other and keep an eye out for everyone . " <h> The taxi driver <p> Andrew King is a taxi driver and decided against going to work through the coronavirus ( Image : Rick Byrne / GrimsbyLive ) <p> Another couple having to stop working through the lockdown were the King family , with Andrew , 57 , and Tracey , 56 , both taxi drivers that made the decision to stop taking fares through the coronavirus . <p> Andrew said : " We have n't been working through the lockdown . We 've been taxi drivers for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we stopped through all this , one was the financial reason , as demand has decreased with less people going to work and going to school , so we were taking a massive loss in earnings compared to how we 'd usually do . <p> " The second was that the entire situation has made us quite jittery . <p> " The day before we stopped , I did a fare and was picking up a regular from Asda along with his wife , who had just been shopping . <p> " I helped him in the front of the car and then his wife got in the back . <p> Andrew has tried fitting plastic sheets via velcro to the back of his car , but has been struggling to make it stick . ( Image : Corey Bedford/Grimsby Live ) <p> " It was then where I noticed she was moaning , and she was sweating and was clearly showing symptoms . When I asked her about it she said " we need to get food " , when she clearly should have been at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not for our health or our passengers , so we stopped working . <p> " I 've been doing housework , I think I 've done just about everything the house needed doing to it while I 've been off ! " <p> Andrew also spoke about returning to the job after the bank holiday weekend , but with a much different look to his car . <p> He said : " I have tried fitting my car with velcro so I could attach some plastic sheets in the car as a shield from the back seat . <p> " I 've been working with the council about it and they 've recommended doing that to protect us but without needing to fit any hard plastic in the car and put us at risk . <p> " For some reason , it does n't seem to be working and sticking to the lining in the car , so I 'm not sure what to do with it at the moment . <p> " At the very least , I 'm going to have PPE in the car and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But honestly , one of the hardest things has been sorting PPE for the car . It 's only this week that I 've been able to get things as it 's been sold out for months . <p> " We 've been using the savings to get by at the moment , but we can claim the self-employment money from the government which will make a big difference . " <h> The married couple <p> The lockdown has not changed much for Hayley Williams , 48 , who is a manager at Libertas Home Care in Louth . <p> She lives with her husband , Mike , 56 , who has recently retired , as is currently enjoying a week off away from work . <p> Hayley said : " I 'm a frontline worker so I have kept on as normal through the lockdown , really ! I work in care , I am a manager at Libertas Home Care in Louth . <p> " I 'm actually on a well-earned week off now , not that we can do much . <p> " My life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the community spirit around here is great , we are all out clapping every Thursday and we had a street party for VE day . <p> " Before this , we had n't done much since everyone first moved in here about 20 years ago , so us being closer with our neighbours is one benefit from all this , at least . <p> " It 's just been full on at work because of it all , and it is a really scary moment for all the staff at the moment . <p> " But it 's really shown how we are frontline workers and have spent a lot of this time working with the vulnerable and the elderly , as we do work out in the community . <p> " My husband has actually just recently retired , so he 's had it lucky , he 's just been stuck inside . This week , for me , I 'm just taking it easy and recharging the batteries before going back to work .

I do n't even know if we 'll be able to start university as normal by then , either . <p> " My mum and dad are civil servants so they a re working as normal . They have been telling me they 're doing a lot more work than usual because of all this , but they are definitely appreciating the overtime !

We have been doing plenty of Zoom meetings and everything alongside our usual work and it 's been busy . <p> " I have two kids who have to do their school work , too , so I have been helping them as well . <p> " The community has been really good through this , though , we were originally asked to join a bingo game for VE day and we thought " why not " and went along . <p> " But it ended up being a really nice day , with music and dancing and everyone enjoying themselves , while social distancing , of course . <p> " We have also been out doing the Thursday NHS claps as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbours and see how everyone 's been doing . <p> " Thankfully we 've been blessed with the weather while in lockdown , and we have a garden so we are able to enjoy it . I just feel sorry for all of the people in flats and apartments that ca n't go and enjoy the nice weather , it must be difficult for them . <p> " It 's been strange in lockdown , though . The first time we went out on a dog walk I felt really claustrophobic because I was thinking " this is the only time I 'm allowed outside of the house today , just an hour long walk . " <p> " We were worried about going out to the supermarket and doing our shopping too , it just puts us all on edge , which is mad when you realise it 's just going to the shops , something that you 've done plenty of times before .

The coronavirus stopped him travelling with work for a bit but they have started doing it again . <p> " When we 've been off , we 've done a lot of walking with the dog , but we 've also been doing a lot more community things with the neighbours . <p> " We had a VE day street party , which was really lovely to see everyone enjoying themselves and spending time with people we would n't normally get time to see . <p> " We 've always been busy at work and in our own lives , but since this , we have spoken to neighbours that we barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who lives by herself on the street , too , so we have all offered to get things for her and check in on her too .

( " Kirkland Lake Gold " or the " Company " ) ( TSX:KL ) ( NYSE:KL ) ( ASX:KLA ) today announced a number of initiatives designed to protect employees , their families and local communities from the COVID-19 virus . Included among the initiatives are the introduction of company-wide health and safety protocols , a temporary reduction in operations at the Detour Lake Mine , a remote operation with a large accommodation camp , until April 30 , 2020 , the suspension of non-essential work at all operations , as well as the suspension of all exploration activities across the Company . <p> In addition , the Company also announced today it will terminate the Automatic Share Purchase Plan ( " ASPP " ) effective March 23 , 2020 . The suspension reflects the Company 's commitment to maintaining financial strength during the current period of uncertainty related to the COVID-19 virus . The ASPP was launched on February 20 , 2020 in connection with the Company 's current normal course issuer bid ( " NCIB " ) to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods and other restrictions . The current NCIB remains in effect on the same terms and conditions as previously disclosed . Under the current NCIB , the Company can purchase up to 10.5 million additional common shares between now and its expiry on May 28 , 2020 . A total of 10.4 million common shares have been repurchased to date through the current NCIB , including 1.9 million shares through the ASPP . Except as set out in this press release , the Company is not aware of any material undisclosed information about its business or its securities . <p> COVID-19 Response Plan <p> At the present time there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at any of the Company 's operations or offices . In response to the health risks associated with COVID-19 , Kirkland Lake Gold has implemented a series of health and safety protocols on a company-wide basis . At the operational level , site-level controls currently in place and/or being introduced include medical screening of all individuals prior to entering site , enhanced cleaning and hygiene practices , social distancing of workers , increased reliance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work from home policies and the suspension of all non-essential work at , and visits to , the Company 's mine sites . <p> Detour Lake Mine <p> Detour Lake Mine is a camp operation , located approximately 185 kilometres northeast of Cochrane , Ontario and 300 kilometres northeast of Timmins , Ontario . The camp at Detour Lake accommodates approximately 1,100 workers at any given time . To reduce risk of the COVID-19 virus , the Company will transition to reduced operations effective March 23 , 2020 . Continuing activities at the mine will include mill processing of reduced feed from the open pit and stockpiles , management of water levels during the spring run-off and environmental management activities . All personnel not essential for the performance of these activities will be required to leave or remain offsite until April 30 , 2020 . In addition , workers from remote First Nations communities and those along the James Bay coast , as well as employees requiring airline transportation to get to and from the minesite , will also be advised to remain off site until the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations , the Company will provide paid leave for 14 working days , the equivalent of a month of normal pay . <p> Approximately 300 workers are expected to remain on-site to perform the essential activities during reduced operations .

While none of our employees have tested positive for COVID-19 , the actions we are taking represent our best judgement , based on what we know today , on how to responsibly protect our people from the pandemic .

We are also discontinuing all non-essential work at our operations and suspending exploration activities across the Company . In the case of Detour , the increased risk represented by the remoteness of the mine and the camp environment requires a more extensive response . As a result , we are transitioning to reduced operations until April 30 , 2020 in order to minimize the number of people required at site . We will continue to produce , though at lower levels , and will ensure critical tasks are completed such as managing water during the spring run-off and ongoing environmental management . It is not possible at this time to estimate the impact of reduced operations on Detour Lake 's 2020 production . <p> " Turning to our NCIB , we have been very committed to buying back our shares through the NCIB , with a total of 10.4 million shares having been repurchased under the current plan to date for a total of $360 million ( C$483 million ) . Given current global events , we believe it is prudent to maintain as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very strong balance sheet with close to $500 million of cash and no debt .

Persistently high case levels in Los Angeles , Chicago and Washington have medical experts concerned . <h> Some White House officials suggest deaths are overcounted . Experts disagree . <p> As the United States continues its advance toward 100,000 coronavirus deaths , a grim milestone the country is expected to reach in the coming days , President Trump and members of his administration have begun questioning the official coronavirus death toll , suggesting the numbers are inflated . <p> In White House meetings , conversations with health officials have returned to similar suspicions : that the data compiled by state health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention include people who have died with the coronavirus but of other conditions . <p> Last Friday , Mr. Trump told reporters that he accepted the current death toll , but that the figures could be " lower than " the official count , which now totals more than 95,000 . <p> Most statisticians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death toll is probably far higher than what is publicly known . People are dying at their houses and nursing homes without ever being tested , they say , and deaths early this year were likely misidentified as influenza or described only as pneumonia . <p> Dr. Deborah L. Birx , the White House 's coronavirus response coordinator , has said publicly that the American health care system incorporates a generous definition of a death caused by Covid-19 . <p> " There are other countries that if you had a pre-existing condition , and let 's say the virus caused you to go to the I.C.U. , and then have a heart or kidney problem -- some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a Covid-19 death , " she said at a White House news conference last month . <p> In a brief interview on Thursday , Dr. Birx stressed that there had been no pressure to alter data . But concerns about official statistics are not limited to the death toll , or to administration officials . <p> Epidemiologists said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that detect active infection with those that detect recovery from Covid-19 -- a system that muddies the picture of the pandemic but raises the percentage of Americans tested as President Trump boasts about testing . <p> Experts said that data from antibody tests and active virus tests should never be mixed . <p> " It just does n't make any sense , " said Natalie Dean , a biostatistician at the University of Florida . " All of us are really baffled . " <p> Epidemiologists , state health officials and a spokeswoman for the C.D.C. said there was no ill intent ; they attributed the flawed reporting system to confusion and fatigue in overworked state and local health departments that typically track infections -- not tests -- during outbreaks . <h> Trump demands that governors let houses of worship reopen . <h> President Trump urged governors to reopen houses of worship immediately , saying he would override them if they did not .

His authority to do so is unclear.CreditCredit ... Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times <p> President Trump stepped into the culture wars again on Friday , taking the side of some religious leaders against governors who have moved slowly in reopening places of worship amid the pandemic . <p> Without any clear authority to do so , Mr. Trump said that he was calling houses of faith , including churches , synagogues , and mosques , " essential services " and urged governors to reopen them " right now . " <p> " Today I am identifying houses of worship -- churches , synagogue and mosques -- as essential places that provide essential services , " Mr. Trump said at a hastily scheduled briefing at the White House on Friday . " Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential but have left out churches and other houses of worship . It 's not right . " <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a number of long-delayed guidelines with suggestions for steps that houses of worship can take to curb the spread of the virus . Among them was a recommendation that religious officials defer to the directive of state and local governments . <p> Still , the president threatened to " override " the governors if they did not follow his order , though it was not immediately clear what powers he was claiming . " I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now , " he said . " If there 's any question , they 're going to have to call me , but they 're not going to be successful in that call . " <p> When the C.D.C. recently released a set of guidelines for reopening , its report largely mirrored an earlier draft version that the White House had rejected because Trump administration officials worried that the suggestions infringed on religious rights . <p> On Friday the C.D.C. 's new guidelines for religious communities suggested that they consider a number of limitations to keep congregations safe . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities . " <p> " Consider suspending or at least decreasing use of a choir/musical ensembles and congregant singing , chanting , or reciting during services or other programming , if appropriate within the faith tradition .

" <p> " Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of frequently touched objects that can not be easily cleaned between persons , such as worship aids , prayer rugs , prayer books , hymnals , religious texts and other bulletins , books , shared cups , or other items received , passed or shared among congregants . " <p> Mr. Trump said Friday at the White House that the nation needs religion . " In America , we need more prayer , not less , " he said . He left without taking questions . <p> David Postman , the chief of staff for Gov .

Paul Ratje/Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images <p> It was not clear what authority President Trump was invoking on Friday when he called for governors " to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now , " and threatened to " override " them if they did not . Soon after he spoke , though , the C.D.C. issued guidelines urging faith leaders to " take steps to limit the size of gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities . " <p> States and localities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the outbreak began . <p> Houses of worship were already allowed to operate in more than half of the states , though many remain under social distancing instructions and many individual churches , synagogues and mosques have decided to remain closed for safety . <p> There have been tensions in places that still have restrictions in place . In California , more than 1,200 pastors signed a declaration protesting the state 's restrictions on in-person services and pledged to reopen their churches by May 31 even if the restrictions are not lifted . Gov . Gavin Newsom , a Democrat , said Friday that the state was working with faith leaders on guidelines to reopen in " a safe and responsible manner " that would be released by Monday at the latest . <p> The state 's guidelines , which will distinguish between megachurches and smaller venues , deal with the configuration of pews and " sanitation protocols , " the governor said . <p> In Illinois , Gov . J.B. Pritzker said on Friday that he would " continue to operate on the basis of science and data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship to open . <p> " I 'm as anxious as anybody to make sure that our churches , our mosques , our synagogues open back to where they were before Covid-19 came along , " Mr. Pritzker said . " We 're gradually moving in that direction . But there 's no doubt the most important thing is , we do not want parishioners to get ill because their faith leaders bring them together . " <p> The president 's call to let in-person services resume came just before one of the biggest Muslim holidays of the year , Eid al-Fitr , which starts Saturday night . <p> Washington State currently allows drive-in services , where congregants remain in their vehicles , and allows houses of worship to bring in personnel to broadcast and stream videos of services . Officials there have been working with an interfaith group to develop guidelines on how religious institutions can safely open up for more in-person activities . <p> And in some states , houses of worships were never required to close .

Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan , who on Friday extended the state 's stay-at-home order through June 12 , has banned large gatherings but also said that houses of worship would not be subject to penalties , leaving the decision in the hands of religious leaders . Many churches , synagogues and mosques there decided to remain closed anyway , and those that are reopening often remain under strict guidelines , including limiting the number of congregants who could enter . <p> In hard-hit New York , Gov . Andrew M. Cuomo moved this week to allow religious gatherings of up to 10 people to resume as long as attendees wear masks and maintain social distance . The announcement was particularly significant for Jewish congregations , where a minyan , defined as 10 people over 13 , is required for a worship service . <p> A view of Venice Beach , Calif. , on May 17 .

Birx , the White House 's coronavirus response coordinator , told reporters at a news conference . She said officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were working with local officials in the three cities " to really understand where these new cases coming from , and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future . " <p> Dr. Birx 's concern did not suggest that the case rates in the three regions were spiking to alarming new levels , but rather that they were not dropping at the same rate as in many other cities . <p> Dr. Birx singled out the Washington area -- which includes the district as well as parts of Maryland and Virginia -- and said it led the country in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from total coronavirus cases . Among those who have tested positive is the former N.B.A. all-star Patrick Ewing , now the men 's basketball coach at Georgetown University in Washington , who announced on Twitter on Friday that he had the virus . <p> Unlike New York , the Washington area has seen no " dramatic decline " in positive test rates or emergency room visits , Dr. Birx said . <p> Further complicating the picture , Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington said on Thursday that the city could begin a phased reopening as early as May 29 , pointing to figures that showed a downward trend in spread of the virus for almost two weeks . Yet on the same day , Washington , D.C. , and Virginia announcedsingle-day highs in cases . <p> The Washington region 's high positive-test percentage comes despite reassuring news in most states : 42 have a rate under 10 percent of positive test results as part of a rolling , seven-day average , Dr. Birx said . <p> The New York area , which includes Jersey City and Newark , is seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .

Figure out a plan to safely reopen your beaches . " <p> Since the pandemic began , tensions have flared over whether too many New York City residents have decamped to outlying vacation areas , potentially taking the virus with them .

But the extension of beach closings in New York City has led to a backlash from local officials in those areas , who say they fear that their shorelines will be overwhelmed by an exodus of sun-starved New Yorkers blocked from their own beaches , which can in normal times attract a million people a day . <p> To maintain social distancing , beaches across the region are moving to limit access to everyone , and special rules have also been adopted to keep outsiders away . <p> The Justice Department on Friday backed an Illinois Republican 's effort to invalidate the state 's stay-at-home order , the latest effort by the federal government to undermine governors ' coronavirus measures . <p> The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois argued in a legal brief that Gov . J. B. Pritzker , a Democrat , had exceeded his authority by extending his executive order for more than 30 days . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General William P.

On Friday , Mr. Dreiband also warned ina letter to Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles that a " long-term lockdown " could be illegal . <p> The move in Illinois came in a lawsuit that was filed by Darren Bailey , a Republican state representative whose fellow lawmakers kicked him out of the building in which they had gathered because he refused to wear a mask .

Delta Air Lines would be able to stop service to Erie , Pa. , and Flint , Mich . United Airlines would be able to stop flights to Fairbanks , Alaska ; Kalamazoo , Mich. ; and Myrtle Beach , S.C. , among other locations . <p> None of the cities would be left without service , the agency said , because it granted exemptions only if other airlines still flew there .

The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus . Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions , but they are usually common in the coldest winter months .

Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply . Masks do n't replace hand washing and social distancing . <h> What should I do if I feel sick ? <p> If you 've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have , and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing , call a doctor .

@@41988441 <p> While the role of behavioural science in the UK 's handling of the pandemic has been criticised , Peter John and Gerry Stoker argue that it is important for governments to try and influence citizens ' behaviour rather than rely on laws that are harder to enforce . They nevertheless explain why a different ' nudging ' approach ought to have been used in this case . <p> Countries across the world have been turning to behavioural science in the fight against coronavirus . In May , The New Scientistproclaimed that ' behavioural science is absolutely central to our fight against the pandemic ' . The well-recognised role of epidemiologists , immunologists , and other scientists is limited ' unless we also factor in the science of human behaviour -- how real humans in the real world act and think -- our understanding is incomplete , and our attempts to defeat the virus will fail ' . But just as the hard sciences have struggled to come up with the answers that can be translated into policy decisions , so too has behavioural science . <p> It is vital , of course , to recognise the scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus and its effects have made decision-making difficult . Lack of data and a shortage of information about the transmission and spread of the virus has meant more reliance on assumptions than ideal . Medical practices and interventions have developed through learning on the spot . <p> Although interventions are claimed to be driven by science , that interface has also proved to be problematic across the board , but especially so in the UK where politicians have been keen to use ' the ' science as a protective cover as part of a strategy of blame avoidance and have , as ever , tended to favour the evidence that most nearly matches their political preferences . Choices about what science to follow have been made and behavioural science has played to decision-makers ' preferences for a top-down approach . <p> Phase 1 for behavioural science-based policy was all about developing and reinforcing a strong and clear messaging about staying at home , social distancing , and taking pressures off the NHS . Phase 2 , launched for England on 13 May , has offered a new top-down brief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages about what it might be possible to do or not . Could the behavioural sciences have found a better path ? <p> As we argued in Nudge , Nudge , Think , Think , much of behavioural science lends itself to that kind of top-down approach because its underlying thinking is that people tend to be limited in cognitive terms , and that a paternalistic expert-led government needs to save them from themselves . The relative secrecy and lack of transparency of British government has compounded this problem , particularly recently when its messaging has got more complicated and more likely to cause confusion . We argued in the book instead for a radically different type of behavioural science , one which is less focused on the fallibilities of human thinking and makes more of its possibilities . Many effective interventions already work with citizen reflection and deliberation and we argue it might have been better to build on that and use a wider cognitive palate for policymakers approaching citizens . <p> We labeled this different approach ' nudge-plus ' and we argue for interventions inspired by recognizing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both lockdown and the coming out of lockdown . People are not simply passively compliant with government messaging . Many were taking steps to deal with the threat of the virus before the government 's instruction and many will decide in future what to do by reflecting on the latest , rather muddled government advice and deciding what best suits them and their families . Nudge plus relies on people understanding the messages and then adjusting their behaviour accordingly . It requires a bit of reflecting before carrying out the preferred action . Past interventions have worked when there was a one-off change that was needed , such as settling an annual tax return or promising to donate your organs . But COVID-19 requires behaviour change day after day . We need something that is going to work for months and months . <p> Citizens could have been approached in a different way . One idea is that the actions need a degree of pre-commitment . People could have been asked to commit first to the strategy , say by inviting them to pledge to stay at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as asking people to think of explaining their plans to an elderly relative before deciding what to do each day . The government has used a lot of text messages , to vulnerable groups , but would it have been possible for citizens to be able reply to a moderated website , or to discuss the measures with others living nearby if they wanted ? <p> Behavioural science has got a lot of stick in recent months , especially in the early phase of the crisis . But this should not decry the importance of governments trying to influence citizens ' behaviour rather than relying on laws and commands that are hard to enforce . Governments and citizens need to work in partnership with each other as we go through this difficult phase of trying to cope with the virus long-term and where policies to prevent widespread infection are hard to explain . Telling people what not to do is easier than advising them about what to do in the right way and in the right circumstances .

@@71894641 <h> Read Next <p> " Test , test , test " has been the WHO 's mantra to tackle the coronavirus pandemic . A recent epidemiological model developed by a consortium of over 400 Indian scientists also strongly supported this plan , showing that testing and quarantining may actually be more effective than a lockdown for controlling COVID-19 . To make the matter even more difficult to manage , studies now indicate that up to 44% of infection transmission can happen in the pre-symptomatic stage . This means that not only do we need to test every symptomatic patient -- we also need to test every asymptomatic contact and ideally even undertake random community sampling to get an idea of the extent of disease . <p> In fact , 53 of 167 journalists ( mostly asymptomatic ) recently tested positive for COVID-19 , demonstrating that among people currently working and interacting with many others during the lockdown , almost a third may contract the disease . <p> Unfortunately , India is doing way less than what it needs to be doing with regards to testing -- although the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) , India 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it recently stated that India is actually doing pretty well , and carries out a much higher 24 tests per positive case , compared to 6.7 in Italy , 5.3 in US , and 3.4 in UK . This is a misleading metric to use . The adequacy of a country 's testing should be based on the number of tests carried out per person , and not on the number of tests per positive case . <p> Data from Worldometers.info , accessed at 12 pm on April 23 , of the number of tests per person in India is shocking . India tests a measly 363 per million population , while the other countries mentioned above test between 8,000 and 25,000 per million . Someone might argue that comparing India with first-world nations is like comparing apples and oranges . Unfortunately , even if we look at other developing countries , India falls way short . In fact , India tests less per million than Pakistan for COVID-19 ! <p> What is the issue here ? India has a large pharmaceutical industry and a decent health tech environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , a head-start of a few months since COVID-19 hit the world , and a five-week lockdown giving us more time to get things back on track . Why are we unable to ramp up testing compared to other countries ? Are we not spending enough on kits , or are there no kits available in the market ? <p> ICMR has n't provided clear answers to these questions , but a deeper probe demonstrates five big issues . <p> 1 . The first and biggest issue is ICMR 's attitude . We have to first acknowledge the problem in order to start finding a solution . However , ICMR genuinely seems to believe that we are testing enough , which is at odds both with both our Indian data and the WHO 's stand . Many believe that ICMR actually understands reality -- but then makes these statements as there are n't enough testing kits available . If so , a better approach would be to honestly accept the fact that we are testing very little , and explaining that we are rationing our kits . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICMR and the Pune-based National Institute of Virology ( NIV ) -- both of which are research organisations with limited clinical activity and patient interaction . As a result , they lack the key clinical inputs needed to make the right decisions . Further , ICMR left out other apex institutes like the PGI Chandigarh , CMC Vellore , NIMHANS Bangalore , and AIIMS and physicians ' associations as well . <p> For example , during the H1N1 outbreak , institutes like NIMHANS used to validate kits as well , but not this time around despite this being a much larger public health emergency . And thanks to the lockdown , Indian companies needing to send their kits for validation to NIV Pune have faced several delays , with some simply unable to reach Pune . It is no surprise then that the first Indian company to get ICMR approval for its test , MyLab Solutions , was based in Pune . Thankfully , ICMR belatedly realised its folly and has now approved more centres to validate testing kits . <p> A bird's-eye view of CMC Vellore . Photo : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of validating testing kits , with significant bureaucracy and red-tapism along with a unique opacity when it comes to sharing data and quality control methods . Even after receiving ICMR 's approval , a company has to get an okay from the Drug Controller General of India , which can take up to a week . Clearly , we need to fast-track such applications as much as possible . Similarly , companies that send their kits for validation to ICMR do n't receive feedback on the accuracy of their kits ; they receive a simple ' pass ' or ' fail ' sort of report . This gives them no room to improve . Tests validated by ICMR also have not performed well on the field , particularly the recent rapid-testing kits whose accuracy reportedly varied from 6% to 71% , and the use of which ICMR suspended for two days . Apart from the kits themselves , what techniques is ICMR using to validate the kits ? How was a kit with 6% accuracy validated for use ? <p> 4 . The fourth issue is India 's inexplicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fullest . The RT-PCR test to detecting COVID-19 is complicated and needs an elaborate laboratory setup ? not an easy task in our limited public health infrastructure . Private laboratories also need some time to setup and standardise their testing protocols before they can ramp up testing . And yet , ICMR took a long time before it allowed private laboratories to start testing . Subsequently , some private hospitals started testing every patient admitted in their hospital for COVID-19 , something outside the purview of ICMR guidelines at the time . A substantial proportion of asymptomatic positive patients were thus detected , preventing many healthcare workers from getting infected . <p> Accordingly , the government has now formally recommended that hospitals close to COVID-19 containment zones test everyone who is admitted . Unfortunately , ICMR still does n't allow private labs to perform the rapid antibody tests . Clearly , we need every possible entity we can use to ramp up testing , and this strange antipathy to private laboratories is n't helping the cause . <p> 5 . Finally , the fifth issue is ICMR 's contradictory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribes for the public . For example , one study authored by ICMR 's own researchers ( submitted to a journal on February 27 ) stated that even a 100% flawless airport screening could not have delayed the COVID-19 epidemic by more than three days due to the role of pre-symptomatic carriers . They also predicted between 200,000 and 10 million cases in Delhi alone based on different government interventions and viral infectivity models . And yet , ICMR refused to widen the scope of testing for a long time beyond February . <p> This discrepancy between what its own research demonstrates and how it acts is perhaps the biggest cause for worry . ICMR either does n't believe its own data and or it does n't wish to act on it either because of external factors or its perceived limitations of the Indian health system . Thankfully , India 's testing numbers have been on the rise over the last few days , and many more kits have been procured recently . <p> The fact remains that India 's medical research organisation really needs to pull up its socks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own data are saying : we need to test more . Most importantly , ICMR needs to demonstrate the urgency required to accelerate testing to whatever extent is feasible during the lockdown and beyond , both in words and in action . This is doable simply by cutting out bureaucracy and being transparent about its testing protocols and results , so that our extremely capable companies get the support they need to help the country . <p> Dr Akshay Baheti is an assistant professor in the department of radiodiagnosis at the Tata Memorial Hospital , Mumbai .

Moviegoers are defined as people who go six times a year or more . <p> " I think there 's a lot to be said for pent-up demand to get out of the house , " Gill said .

Social distancing restrictions will probably still be in place in many areas , and analysts do n't expect moviegoing to return to pre-pandemic levels until there 's a vaccine , if ever . Theaters that open are likely to do so with limited seating , robust cleaning schedules and mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 50% capacity , with seats blocked off in a checkerboard format in many locations . <p> Advertisement <p> And even without fears of the coronavirus , there was no guarantee " Unhinged " would be a hit . Distributors have struggled in recent years to find audiences for mid-budget movies , as the audience for such films migrates online . <p> On the plus side , the new movie wo n't be facing competition for screens . Until " Unhinged , " the theaters that reopen will probably be playing older titles to get customers used to the idea of going back . <p> " It wo n't be , ' Do you want to go to the movies , ' it 'll be , ' Do you want to go to the movie ? ' " Gill joked . <p> Gill was previously president of Avi Lerner 's Millennium Films , where he worked on movies including " The Hitman 's Bodyguard " and the " Olympus Has Fallen " series .

The countries which share land borders with India are China , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Bhutan , Nepal , Myanmar and Afghanistan . The Department of Economic Affairs , under the ministry , has notified these amendments to the foreign direct investment ( FDI ) policy under the Foreign Exchange Management Act , 1999 ( FEMA ) . " In exercise of the powers conferred by clauses ( aa ) and ( ab ) of sub-section ( 2 ) of section 46 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act , 1999 , the Central Government hereby makes the following rules further to amend the Foreign Exchange Management ( Non-debt Instruments ) Rules , 2019 ... , " the department said in a notification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its implementation .

China has stated that these new norms violate the World Trade Organisation 's ( WTO ) principle of non-discrimination and are against the general trend of free trade .

During the same period , India has attracted Rs 48 lakh from Bangladesh , Rs 18.18 crore from Nepal , Rs 35.78 crore from Myanmar , and Rs 16.42 crore from Afghanistan . There are no investments from Pakistan and Bhutan .

@@41975041 <h> Symptoms of COVID-related inflammatory syndrome in kids are ' not subtle ' -- here are the two key signs to look for <p> As many as five children in New York have reportedly died from a " pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome , " which pediatricians believe is triggered by the coronavirus . The syndrome , first reported in London , has been compared to other autoimmune conditions such as Kawasaki disease ( KD ) and toxic shock syndrome ( TSS ) . But in interviews with Yahoo Life , multiple pediatricians say that the illness is increasingly different from those illnesses -- and that the symptoms are unmistakable . <p> " I believe and I think many people believe it 's a different problem , a different syndrome that 's not typical Kawasaki disease , " says Dr. Stanford Shulman , a professor of pediatrics with a focus on infectious disease at Northwestern University . " This syndrome has a few features similar to Kawasaki , but many more features that are very different . " <p> Reports of children with a coronavirus-linked inflammatory syndrome are increasing across the nation . Here is what to look for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been reported in New York thus far , doctors in Boston , Philadelphia , Los Angeles and -- according to Shulman -- Chicago now say that they 've seen suspected cases as well . Thus far , the pediatricians say the patients seem to be responding well to treatment and that the majority make a full recovery . Many of the kids have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies , suggesting that they contracted the virus weeks before and recovered . <p> Given that timeline , experts believe that more cases will be appearing in other states in the coming weeks . To help alleviate fears among parents , here 's what the experts know thus far . <h> Two key symptoms are high fever and gastrointestinal distress <p> Shulman says that one of the biggest differences between this new syndrome and KD is the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms . " The symptoms patients are presenting with ... there 's lots of abdominal pain and diarrhea , which are very uncommon in Kawasaki children , " says Shulman . The other obvious symptom is a fever above 102 ? F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fevers , lots of abdominal pain -- with or without diarrhea or vomiting -- and looks really sick , they need to go to an emergency room to be evaluated . " Other symptoms to look for include rash , conjunctivitis and difficulty breathing . <h> Shock is likely what is driving the fatalities <p> Dr. Steven Kernie , chief of pediatric critical care medicine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital , has seen multiple cases of the syndrome as well and says that , aside from abdominal pain and high fever , parents should look out for symptoms of shock , such as clammy skin and racing heart rate . Shock , according to the Mayo Clinic , is defined as " a sudden drop in blood flow " that can deprive the organs of blood and oxygen . <p> This reaction seems to align more with toxic shock syndrome , which is caused by a bacterial infection , than KD . " It 's the shock piece that is different ... where they need to be in the ICU and they need to be on medications to help their heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a press conference Monday , health officials in New York said they 've seen evidence that shock in these patients is causing " multi-organ failure . " They note that if recognized early , shock is treatable -- and that if treated early , long-term effects are likely " pretty negligible . " <h> It is unlikely to be contagious <p> Both Kernie and Shulman say the syndrome is essentially a " hyper-inflammation " in the body , typically post-infection . But while COVID-19 is very easy to pass on to others , Kernie says this syndrome is not transmissible . " It 's not running in families , and it 's not contagious , " says Kernie . " Although we 're seeing a lot of it now , we have seen things like Kawasaki disease that oftentimes occur after a viral infection , so I believe that it 's really just because of the sheer volume of kids that have been exposed to COVID that we 're seeing a cluster of cases . " <h> It does not appear more prevalent among Asian children <p> Kawasaki disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more common among kids of Asian and Pacific Island descent . But Kernie says that 's not the case here . " We 've called our colleagues in Japan who are Kawasaki experts , and they 're not seeing any of this . None . Same thing for China , " says Shulman . He notes that it 's too soon to draw any conclusions about who is most at risk , but he reveals that six out of the eight children in London with the syndrome were of Afro-Caribbean descent . " So far , the demographics are very different , " he says . No data on the demographics of the kids affected in the U.S. has been released , but the National Institutes of Health has begun studying the syndrome . <h> Toddlers do not appear to be at heightened risk <p> Another marked change from KD , which generally affects children under 5 , and TSS , which is most common among teens , is the demographic affected . " The average age of this new syndrome is about 8 to 12 years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shulman says . In New York , officials say , the patients range in age from 5 to 9 years old . <h> Doctors have been using the same treatment used for KD , and it 's working <p> Treatment for KD is typically what 's known as intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) , a concentrated amount of healthy antibodies from thousands of blood donors . While not all symptoms align with KD , this method seems to be working . " Kawasaki disease is typically treated with IVIG , and patients overall do quite well . It seems like the patients we 've heard about have also responded to IVIG , " he says . " Most of those patients have recovered and been discharged . So that 's the good news . " <h> Overall , it remains rare and symptoms are tough to miss <p> It 's too soon to know exactly how many kids will be affected , but Shulman says he " does not expect this to turn out to be an extremely common problem . " Kernie agrees . " I would reassure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kernie says . Both suggest parents stay vigilant , but also take solace in the fact that if a child has this syndrome , it will likely be near impossible to miss . " The symptoms are n't subtle . The kids look sick . They have a fever . They often have abdominal distension and diarrhea , " says Kernie . " There are diseases where you put a perfectly healthy child to bed at night and you wake up and they 're horribly sick . This is not that -- it is n't coming out of nowhere . "

After largely dropping contact testing on March 12 , the UK 's scheme will be taking off from a standing start . Wide-scale testing , which forms the central part of any contact tracing scheme , is already faltering as the government has hit its self-imposed 100,000-a-day testing target just twice since it was announced .

Their escape came via a road which David describes as the worst in the world . <p> " The Srinagar to Jammu road is a terrifying journey , " he admitted . " It took us 16 hours to travel 250 miles . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cliff , with no barriers . There are bumps all the way , and horses and goats coming in the opposite direction.At the best of times , you can only just get two cars passing by each other , but in the winter the track becomes smaller with snow , so for two days there is only traffic allowed in one direction and then two days the other way . <p> " I 'd done it once before and said never again , but desperation meant we had to . " <p> David , Kym and Mason , along with English footballer Kallum Higginbotham and two Scottish coaches , were told their journey could have been even worse . <p> " We were asked if we 'd made it through the borders OK , because two militants had just been shot and as a result everything was shut down , " said the former Scotland international . " We 'd left at 5am to start the trip , but had we departed later we would n't have got out at all . " <p> The relieved party flew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Once we were through security , it was great to know we were on our way . <p> " The flight was jam-packed and the staff all had white protective suits on . We had to wear masks . <p> " There were no meals . Instead , we were given a plastic bag with a cheese sandwich and chocolate buttons , but it was just great to get out . " <p> From London , a minibus eventually returned David and his family to Aberdeen at 6am on Friday . " It 's good to be home , " he continued . " My mum 's not well but now I 'm back I can go and stand outside her window from a safe distance and talk to her . " <p> This was David 's third season in Kashmir . He won the second division title with the club in his first season , came third in the top league last year and was on course for a second-placed finish this campaign . <p> " When you look at where we started from -- no training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players bringing their own footballs -- I did n't realise what I was getting in to , " he explained . <p> " It 's in a war zone , a really troubled region , and I do n't think any manager in the world has had to deal with what I do on a daily basis . Every morning when I wake up , I know there 's going to be something . <p> " But it 's not only made me a better coach , but a better person . It makes you realise how lucky we have it at home . " <p> The incredible story of Real Kashmir under David has brought huge media attention . A Bollywood movie is to be made about their rise and a BBC Scotland documentary last year won a Scottish Bafta and was a ratings winner . <p> The follow-up , Return To Real Kashmir FC , airs this week and shows David exploring the country while trying to take his team to the next level . <p> " I 've seen some amazing things , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh at you , because of the situation , but it really is a lovely place . It 's just in the wrong location . " <p> The same can be said for his job , and it 's for that reason Davie says he will return to Real Kashmir once the coronavirus lockdown is over and football can be played again . <p> " I have a great relationship with the club 's owner , Sandeep Chattoo , and his family , " he said . " The pandemic there is three or four weeks behind everywhere else , and obviously with the conditions in some parts of India it might take them longer to recover . <p> " I feel like I need to try to win the championship for him next year , so I do n't know when I 'll be able to go back , but I will .

@@31793141 <h> Governments likely to defer to Big Tech on Covid-19 contact tracing <p> From the UK 's NHS to the City of Berkeley , governments and health authorities around the world are preparing to launch Bluetooth apps for contact tracing during the Covid-19 pandemic . With such apps , infected users could anonymously alert everyone they previously came in contact with while they were at risk of transmitting the virus . But lingering questions remain about the privacy and efficacy of such smartphone-based contact tracing . <p> Google and Apple are teaming up to unveil an API for digital contact tracing in May , but are restricting its use to public health authorities and governments . Such apps will be based on open-source protocols designed by leading academic institutions , such as MIT 's Safe Paths , and Covid Watch , a collaboration by Stanford University and the University of Waterloo . <p> But the world 's two largest mobile platform operators have also put strict limits on how health agencies can access the data themselves . <p> NHS , which is working on a contact-tracing app , is currently sparring with Google and Apple over such limits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on population flows in the aggregate , and other detailed features to track the spread of the virus . But Google and Apple , in the interest of protecting privacy , wo n't allow it . <p> Rhys Fenwick , a spokesperson for Covid Watch , told Quartz that the group recently began advising the NHS on building its app . Covid Watch has expressed support for the decentralized approach favored by Google and Apple , which prevents governments from storing information collected from a user 's phone in one centralized location . The tech giants argued in a press call this week that such restrictions would keep governments from using contact tracing for mass surveillance . Singapore 's TraceTogether app , while it uses person-to-person Bluetooth detection , stores data in a centralized server , which some say made it more vulnerable to hacking and misuse . <p> Google and Apple have made some adjustments that will allow digital contact tracing apps to run more smoothly . Normally , apps that use Bluetooth ca n't operate in the background , unless it 's streaming audio or you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions for digital contact tracing . <p> Fenwick said there was disagreement , even among proponents of digital contact tracing , over how the technology should be used and in what fashion . " The specific tradeoff between privacy and research utility is , evidently , one on which there is disagreement . Covid Watch leans heavily to the side of privacy ; we are willing to sacrifice social network data if that is the only reliable way of ensuring anonymity , as it seems to be . There is a diversity of opinions on this matter ; we are confident that NHS England will arrive at a sensible result that respects and preserves the privacy of its users , " Fenwick wrote in an email to Quartz . <p> There 's also doubt over how effective digital contact tracing will be in regions with a particularly high number of cases , such as New York City , or countries where there is limited access to testing . In those situations , apps will be unable to account for the number of asymptomatic people who carry the virus . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the many essential workers who come into contact with strangers on a daily basis , such as a delivery driver or grocery store workers . It could also be effective as regions gradually lift their lockdown measures and transition back to normal life . <p> " Such an app might be helpful with contact tracing in a time we hope is coming soon , when community transmission is low enough that the population can stop sheltering in place , and when there is sufficient testing to quickly and efficiently diagnose COVID-19 at scale , " wrote the Electronic Frontier Foundation in a statement on its website . While civil liberties groups like the EFF and ACLU favor a decentralized approach , both groups stressed that all digital contact tracing still needed strong privacy safeguards . <p> Meanwhile , there is disagreement in Europe over whether its approach will be decentralized or centralized . France and Germany have both started building apps that rely on central servers , coming into conflict with Google and Apple 's plans . Both nations are members of PEPP-PT -- Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact tracing apps in the EU . <p> Christopher Boos of PEPP-PT told the New York Times that the group 's platform will work in either a centralized or decentralized setting . But they may not have a choice . The European Union Commission issued guidelines for contact tracing on Friday ( April 17 ) that backed a decentralized approach that followed GDPR , EU 's data privacy law . Several nations including Austria , France , Germany , Italy , and Spain have agreed to develop country-specific apps that follow the PEPP-PT model . PEPP-PT contact tracing apps will be interoperable , meaning they will work when travel restrictions are lifted in Europe . The coalition has also agreed that its apps will be mutually interoperable with the NHSX app in the UK . <p> Proponents of Bluetooth apps say they 'll do a better job of preserving privacy and keeping identities anonymous than apps that use GPS and location tracking . But critics of digital contact tracing remain dubious . Even Apple and Google admitted in a press call earlier this week that no technology is " unhackable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think that cellphone tracking will help curb the virus , according to Pew Research survey results released this week . But in the coming months , billions will be able to do so without even downloading an app , as Google and Apple roll out contact tracing in their operating systems . <p> Correction : An earlier version of this article inaccurately stated that the EU Commission backs a centralized approach . Their guidelines are in favor of a decentralized approach . Updated with further comment from PEPP-PT.

Tina Sablan ( Ind-Saipan ) regarding the decision-making that happens when sourcing for vendors . <p> " Usually , the first 30 , 45 , sometimes 60 days of a disaster , it 's ' get it where you can , ' ' get it where you already know they can deliver , ' " he said , " ...

" <p> However , according to Guerrero , some contracts can get cancelled either due to the inability of the vendor to supply what is needed , or if the purchase is no longer a need . <p> " Sometimes , it 's the inability of the vendor to supply the good or service that could cause cancellation .

@@84475441 <p> It was an unusual moment of frankness from the White House on Monday when the coronavirus task force offered new estimates of the toll the virus might exact on the American public . By holding firm on social distancing efforts , we were told , we might limit the number of deaths from the virus to somewhere between 100,000 and 240,000 over the course of the pandemic . It 's a grim tally , but better than the millions that might die should the country not follow the offered recommendations . <p> The peak of the outbreak would come in the middle of April , task force member Deborah Birx explained . She showed a graph using modeling from the University of Washington 's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) . The projected peak would come on April 15 , with 2,214 deaths on that day . <p> Late Wednesday night , the IHME released revised estimates , based on new data . During the first wave of the epidemic , its model projects , the death toll will be 93,765 -- an increase of 14 percent from its model the previous day . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deaths through July . In the fall and winter , the virus is expected to reemerge and pose a significant threat once again . <p> That shift is a function in part of things looking more bleak over the short term . The new model suggests that the number of deaths each day is now most likely to peak on April 16 , a day later than suggested Monday , with 400 more deaths that day . <p> In other words , the data from Monday have been shifted upward significantly -- particularly the worst-case scenario represented by the upper-bound of the uncertainty area displayed on the graph . The graph presented from the White House on Monday stopped at about 3,500 deaths a day . The new estimate projects a possible worst-case peak of 4,400 deaths on April 21 . <p> Why the shift ? Models of pandemics like the coronavirus outbreak , as FiveThirtyEight explained on Tuesday , are very tricky . What 's more , new data mean a shift in what 's projected . Just as models of the likely winner of the Democratic primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , new data fed into coronavirus models can change the expected outcome . <p> " What we do is that every time we get more data , you feed it back in and relook at the model .

" Models are as good as the assumptions you put into them , and as we get more data , then you put it in and that might change , " he added . <p> Slideshow by photo services <p> One bit of data added to the IHME models was the actual number of deaths over the past few days . The graph presented on Monday , for example , included an estimate that there would be about 850 deaths on April 1 . Data from Johns Hopkins University indicates that the number was closer to 890 -- though even that figure includes some uncertainty .

If the model continues to be revised upward , the figure could approach 170,000 -- just from the first three months of deaths . <p> An important factor in the IHME data is how the peaks in deaths will be staggered around the country . New York , currently the main flash point of the outbreak in the United States , is expected to peak at 855 deaths on April 10 . Alabama is projected to peak a bit later , with 303 deaths on April 19 .

Much of the scepticism came largely as the Budget was more of intent and lacked sufficient concrete measures to enthuse local demand , even as the emerging uncertainty from the coronavirus outbreak has not yet been factored in . <p> " To get the Indian economy out of the ongoing slump , bolder decisions were required and that 's where this Budget failed to deliver , " brokerage Bernstein ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budget for 2020-21 " directionless " . <p> Most brokerage houses believe the government 's allocation for subsidies and spending on social and rural schemes -- just 7% higher from last year -- is lower than that needed to pump-prime the economy . <p> The cut in allocation to the government 's flagship job guarantee scheme and the expected sharp slump in capital expenditure growth to 2% next financial year from an estimated 16% in the current one are worries , said brokerage Ambit Capital . <p> The brokerage 's report titled ' How long can hope be a strategy ' pithily summarised that changes in the Budget were cosmetic in nature and " will have minimal effect " on economic growth next year . <p> Analysts also expressed concerned over the ability of the government to bridge the revenue-expenditure gap next year , with some stating that the expected 2.1 trln rupees from disinvestment in state-owned companies was a tall ask . <p> The extent of hand-wringing over prospects of economic growth can be gauged from the post-Budget note by Kotak Institutional Equities that said " No hope without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little on concrete action , the market is expected to look for succour in smaller events such as gains that could accrue from the abolition of dividend distribution tax . <p> Bernstein India reiterated that the benchmark Nifty 50 index would give returns of only 5% in 2020 and that the Budget was broadly neutral for every sector . <p> Was the market expecting too much , asked BofA Securities rhetorically , stating that the finance minister had restricted fiscal deficit in line with expectation , but noting that the recent excitement in mid-cap stocks could peter out . <p> " The markets ' disappointment with the Budget will last a short while ...

In other words , Nunes would have had a ton more to lose on May 9 than Spencer , so it 's no surprise she pulled out first . Will other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't bet against it . <p> 3 . That said , I really hope Nunes ' next fight is against Spencer , whenever that time comes . I think Spencer can give her a tough fight , especially if they go to the ground . <p> 4 . Henry Cejudo deserved all the criticism in the world when he campaigned for the Jose Aldo fight , but I do n't think he deserves much criticism for the Dominick Cruz fight . Why ? Well , for starters , Aldo ca n't enter the country . Next , Petr Yan ca n't enter the country . Then , Aljamain Sterling is still not 100% following wrist surgery , and Cory Sandhagen has already said it 's too hard to fully prepare for a fight these days , although he told USA Today he would step in if Cruz dropped out for whatever reason . There are no other options out there , and Cruz is the biggest fight possible , even if everyone were available . Do n't forget , without Dominick Cruz there is no bantamweight division . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm still not completely sold on the idea that Fight Island will happen , but I will say that after speaking to several fighters who were on the Dana White-hosted conference calls this week , the impression they got is that Fight Island is very real . According to them , White reiterated several times that it would be a thing , and soon . We shall see . <p> 6 . I want to give a lot of credit to Lyman Good . It 's never easy being the first to speak about anything personal , but he was the first active UFC fighter to reveal he had the coronavirus . That takes a lot of guts . I wonder if others will follow suit . Nevertheless , I 'm very glad to hear he and his loved ones are doing well and have since tested negative . <p> play <p> 3:36 <h> Lyman Good reveals he tested positive for coronavirus <p> Lyman Good explains the timeline that led to him testing positive for the coronavirus and pulling out his scheduled fight for April 18 . <p> 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire season , though I think it ultimately made the right call . It will be interesting to see if it is able to hold one-off events later in the year , and if so , does the PFL just put together the most fun fights possible ? I would suggest doing that . Heck , put together a card with four fights and sprinkle in some classic WSOF fights on the broadcast . A lot of fans have n't seen those yet . Give us some Justin Gaethje , Marlon Moraes and Anthony Johnson action . Who says no ? <p> 8 . Speaking of the PFL , I commend it for paying the fighters a monthly stipend , but I am reserving full judgment until we find out how much it is actually paying . A lot of these fighters will now be forced to sit on the sidelines for over a year . A lot of them signed with the PFL in hopes of winning the million-dollar purse . Will the stipend come anywhere near the money they would have made if they fought multiple times this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made for letting them out of their deals in 2020 , only to be back under contract in 2021 ? This will be interesting to monitor . <p> 9 . I am happy that the UFC renamed its May 9 event UFC 249 and not UFC 250 . I always thought it was weird that it just skipped over UFC 151 and 177 back in the day . This makes me feel good . <p> 10 . The Virginia commission denied Ion Cutelaba 's appeal of his controversial TKO loss to Magomed Ankalaev in February . I thought the stoppage was early , but I am not surprised at all the appeal was denied . It 's virtually impossible to get one of those calls overturned , even if the calls are egregious . I wish that was n't the case . <p> 11 . Speaking of Cutelaba , his team tells me he is now in quarantine in his home country of Moldova for another week after he decided to fly from there to Las Vegas for the April 18 card that never happened . I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without knowing where the card was going to take place , only to be forced to return home once the event was canceled . No word on how much they will be compensated for their troubles . <p> 12 . I 'm told the fighters who were slated to compete on the ill-fated London card on March 21 received no more than $20,000 . As you can imagine , some of the higher earners are n't too pleased with that amount , while others were happy to get something for nothing . <p> 13 . The more time passes , the more I think it would be a really bad idea to not book Jon Jones vs . Dominick Reyes 2 right away . Yes , I know Jan Blachowicz looked great against Corey Anderson , but does anyone really think the Blachowicz fight is bigger financially and more intriguing than the Reyes fight ? I sure do n't . <p> 14 . I initially thought it was n't a great idea for Tony Ferguson to make weight last week for a fight that was n't happening , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different kind of cat . He thrives under circumstances like this . He ca n't just take his foot off the gas . Also , let 's not pretend fighters have n't made weight twice in a month . Heck , Chris Leben once fought twice in the span of two weeks . At least Ferguson did n't get punched after making weight last Friday . So , it was a chore , no doubt , but now he 's back to normal and gears up for May 9 .

" This was not an honorific title but one that was well earned and well deserved . He has been the most vicious attack dog on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 's blame China team . <p> As early as January , when the world was just beginning to grasp the full significance of Covid-19 , Cotton charged that the virus that causes the respiratory disease came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China 's Hubei province . He planted the seeds of accusation without providing any supporting evidence , but that 's how propaganda is supposed to work . <p> Sometimes he shared with the media that it may have been an accident that the Wuhan lab let the virus loose . Other times he hinted that the lab may have created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His allegations were carefully vague so that he could not be pinned down . <p> Pompeo and President Donald Trump play the same blame game even though the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a press release last Thursday stating : " The intelligence community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified . " ( Of course , this statement is subject to withdrawal , if the boss threatens to fire the DNI . ) <h> Cotton follows Ferguson <p> Cotton also accused China of deliberately letting the virus loose on the world . He was drawing on Harvard historian Niall Ferguson 's assertion that China let international flights depart from Wuhan , which was factually incorrect . Daniel Bell , a fellow academic , showed Ferguson that the Wuhan airport had shut down all flights , not just domestic ones , on January 23 . Ferguson refused to retract his allegation but stood by his lie . <p> It 's widely recognized that every lie diminishes the reputation of the perpetrator , but Cotton has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation for the economic damage and lives lost due to Covid-19 . Of course , he would never call the contagion by the official name . To him , it 's always the " Chinese " virus . <p> Cotton cleverly thought he could lead a lawsuit to cancel the trillion-dollar IOU the US government owes China . Frankly , that 's going to a lot of trouble to weasel out of a trillion-dollar debt . It would be much easier for the US Federal Reserve simply to print one or two or three trillion dollars with the snap of congressional fingers . Larry Kudlow , President Trump 's economic adviser , also shuddered at the thought of what such a default would do to the creditworthiness of the dollar . <p> More recently , Cotton thought out loud on Fox News that it was fine for students from China to come to the US to study Shakespeare but not for quantum computing or artificial intelligence . That was a strange juxtaposition . <h> Study football at Arkansas <p> Of course , if Chinese students aspire to become Shakespeare scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The University of Arkansas might be a backup choice if a student could n't get into the University of Alabama to study college football . <p> Cotton appears to be under the notion that Chinese students majoring in science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) come to the US to steal secrets . Quantum computing and artificial intelligence happen to be two disciplines that American scholars are just as likely to go to China to study as vice versa . In some ways , China is as up to date and may be even ahead of the US . <p> It 's apparent that Cotton does n't understand much about STEM education at the university and postgraduate levels . There are a bit over a million international students in the US and slightly more than one-third are from China . Most of them are funded by their families . Since Beijing is not paying their way , there 's no need to spy for their tuition . <p> More important , foreign students pay full tuition and represent a significant source of revenue for American colleges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEM departments depend on the quality of their students to maintain the quality of the research output and thus maintaining their reputation for excellence . A recent survey showed that among nationalities , students from China ranked second-highest in IQ while American students came in at No 28 . That 's why top-tier schools such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Stanford and others aggressively recruit students from China . <p> Another surprising revelation was that the five most popular majors among the Chinese students were business management , computer science , finance , mathematics and economics , in that order . This suggests that students from China are not just coming to the US for STEM but are just as interested in learning how to manage businesses the way it is done in the West . <p> Students from China have discovered that they are four times as likely to be a victim of a violent crime while in the US ( and this was before the Covid-19 pandemic induced xenophobia ) than if they stayed home .

Earlier in March , Lukashenko told the nations to take to the fields and drive tractors to fend off the virus , and has told his government the pandemic is nothing more than a " psychosis " . <p> The total number of coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) cases in Belarus , a country in Eastern Europe of almost 10mn people , has grown to 7,281 , while 58 people have died , the nation 's health authorities reported on April 22 . <p> According to the recommendations of a team of WHO experts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pandemic , the WHO said in a statement on April 21 . <p> " The government has already implemented containment measures -- testing suspect cases , tracing their contacts and isolating the sick .

With community transmission established , it is important to complement these interventions with physical distancing measures , " the statement reads . <p> According to the WHO , physical distancing measures list : postponing large gatherings , including sports , religious and cultural events ; placing in quarantine contacts of confirmed patients and people potentially exposed to the virus ; introducing options for teleworking , and distance learning for schools , universities and other educational institutions , and suspending nonessential business ; reducing nonessential movements , especially for high-risk groups . <p> Meanwhile , Lukashenko said on April 22 that Belarus will not disregard the recommendations of the WHO but will act accordingly to the developments . <p> " The measures recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state news agency BELTA qyoted him asasaying .

Therefore , we will not shrug off the the recommendations , but we must act accordingly , based on a set of recommendations , our experience .

As the saying goes , we must not let a serious crisis go to waste . <p> The coronavirus epidemic should have made the world 's superpowers realise how helpless they are against a virus so nanoscale that scientists can only fathom it through a micrograph with the help of an electron microscope . Is n't this a time to stop and ponder how feeble and useless the biggest and the most powerful weapons in their arsenals are ? The Mother of All Bombs which the United States President Donald Trump dropped on Afghanistan in 2017 boasting it was the most powerful conventional bomb the US has in its arsenal is of no use against an invisible enemy . <p> The nine nuclear powers have some 4,000 nuclear warheads in their possession , but they appear literally damp squibs . The Tomahawks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S-400s , the Dongfengs , the Agnis , the Shaheens , the Khorramshahrs , the Jerichos , all types of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and powerful projectiles that can reduce cities and habitats to rubble appear good-for-nothing lumps of metal . The United States ' F-16s , Russia 's MiGs and China 's J-20 aircraft are no checks against the highly virulent virus . America 's Abrams-1 , Russia 's T-90As and China 's T-99 battle tanks can not crush the new coronavirus that has already taken the lives of more than 8,000 people and affected more than 200,000 people worldwide , compelling the most developed nations to resort to extreme measures such as lockdowns and stopping flights . <p> We would have saved lives , if the trillions of dollars nations have dumped on weapons had been used in the development of their health sectors , producing more doctors , nurses and health professionals , in building more hospitals , turning their arsenals into warehouses to store medical ventilators to be used in times of health crises such as the one we are now facing . <p> The cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.4 million . This money is sufficient to produce more than 1,000 ventilators . The lack of foresight to invest more on health and the over expenditure on defence have led to the health systems of the US , Italy and other developed nations creaking under pressure without adequate hospital beds and ventilators . <p> The United States must have easily fired more than 3,000 Tomahawks since 1998 on Afghanistan , Iraq and Syria in wars that have not made the US any safer than it was before but only made arms dealers multi billionaires . <p> The trillions of dollars in public money spent on destructive wars should have been used on health sector research and development or invested in projects to produce in the US and other countries brilliant scientists who will find cures for the Covid-19 and incurable diseases such as cancer . This is responsible superpower behaviour . The pandemic has exposed the unpreparedness of the world 's most advanced nations to face a health crisis . This is because they have a lopsided understanding of what security is . Security is not protecting the borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is little meaning in protecting the borders from the enemy if leaders let the people under their care die of diseases due to lack of efficient medical care geared to face health emergencies . <p> " We would have saved lives , if the trillions of dollars nations have dumped on weapons had been used in the development of their health sectors , producing more doctors " <p> But as you read this column , billions of dollars are spent on developing new supersonic weapons capable of killing tens of thousands of people in one blast , as the big power arms race loses no momentum , coronavirus or not . The virus seems to say , " Oh mankind , spend not your wealth in warfare or to promote hatred , but spend it in nurturing unity among nations and spreading love .

Even as the new coronavirus was spreading its tentacles far and wide , the racism virus was killing people in India , the land of the Buddha and Gandhi . <p> The so-called Islamic terrorists also carry this virus in their hearts . In their warped interpretation of Islam , all those who do not follow their ideology are lesser humans and therefore they have no qualms about killing the ' others ' , including Muslims of other sects .

@@71956541 <p> International lawyers love a good crisis , argues Hilary Charlesworth , though this tendency can often impoverish the discipline of international law . So whilst all eyes are drawn to the pandemic , we alert you to the closing of civil society space in many parts of the globe , including for women human rights defenders . On 16 March 2020 , a group of UN human rights experts said that ' emergency declarations based on the COVID-19 outbreak should not be used as a basis to target particular groups , minorities , or individuals . It should not function as a cover for repressive action under the guise of protecting health ... and should not be used simply to quash dissent . ' We should stay focused on the logics and mechanisms which seek to prevent human rights violations , especially in a time of crisis . We argue that a more meaningful and gendered definition of who deserves protection as a human rights defender is required to protect those local actors on whom the international human rights system depends . <p> Who defines the defenders ? <p> Twenty-five years ago , governments stated in the Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human rights must be protected ' . Three years later , in 1998 UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/53/144 adopted the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders . Its provisions drew from international human rights law treaties , including the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , to declare that : <p> ' Everyone has the right , individually and in association with others , to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels ' ( Article 1 ) . <p> The Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders has considered women human rights defenders to include both female human rights defenders , and other human rights defenders who work in the defence of women 's rights or on gender issues ( A/HRC/16/44 , 2010 ) . This work can often be less visible . The COVID-19 pandemic has seen sweeping restrictions on freedom of movement and association that can mask targeting of all HRDs , for example , in Hong Kong and China , but especially women . Some prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including peaceful women human rights defenders . For example , Human Rights Watch reports that Nasrin Sotoudeh , Narges Mohammidi and Atena Daemi remain imprisoned in Iran . Those who seek to defend reproductive rights and personal safety of women have had hard-won progress reversed by government responses to the pandemic , denying access to contraception or repealing safe abortion laws . Current UNFPA data reveals that the pandemic has had terrible consequences for reproductive rights and intimate partner and family violence globally . <p> Who protects the defenders ? <p> Along with limited visibility of women human rights defenders , the international system struggles to provide meaningful protection . The UN human rights mechanisms have long tried to respond to the targeting , harassment and disappearance of human rights defenders in many countries , but the number of incidents is rising . According to data from Front Line Defenders , in 2014 there were over 130 murders of human rights defenders . In 2016 , the number rose to nearly double , totalling 281 killings in 25 countries . 49 percent of these HRDs were defending land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 2019 , NGOs recorded 304 deaths . <p> Protection of human rights defenders is a wicked problem . Perpetrators of violations and abuses against defenders include the police , military , members of the judiciary , local authorities , state authorities , security services , paramilitary and other armed groups , the media , and corporations . These are also largely the actors that UN mechanisms call upon to protect human rights defenders . For example , the UN Secretary-General releases an annual ' Reprisals Report ' directed to UN members , a public compilation of reported cases of intimidation and reprisals against those cooperating with the UN . Common abuses include arbitrary arrest or detention , threats , harassment , judicial investigation , extrajudicial execution and murder . Human Rights Defenders have also paid the price for their activism in more subtle but nonetheless damaging ways-they have been dismissed from their jobs , evicted from their homes , defamed , ostracized , and stigmatized . Around the world , many human rights defenders struggle to continue their work in debilitating and deteriorating conditions caused by the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender-specific acts of intimidation and violence including rape and other forms of sexual violence , much more often facing threats to their children . <p> Time for critical reflection <p> But defining who is a human rights defender , and particularly a woman human rights defender , is also a difficult task . Every aspect of the term ' Women Human Rights Defender ' is deeply contested : who is a ' woman ' , what kind of rights , how the right is allowed to be ' defended ' . This is not just a semantic exercise . The question of who is considered a women human rights defender has consequences for whether and how an individual is included in statistics and reports about human rights defenders , the harms they experience ( and successes ) , who might benefit from ' protection ' or even be eligible for academic fellowships and civil society programs , and potentially , who might be targeted for repressive counter-actions . <p> International law offers a framework for protecting women human rights defenders including UN resolutions , reports , guidelines and associated civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We argue that this system is insufficient to address the scale of the problem , and often relies on posthumous recognition : a person is identified as a human rights defender if they satisfy the international gaze after their death . This is due to the lack of definitional certainty in the term ; the lack of specificity in what constitutes protection outside a narrow concept of physical security ; and the lack of protection mechanisms available in many contexts . <p> Instead we should reimagine protection systems at local levels that increase agency and options based on deep consultation and context , and serious diplomatic interventions . This is particularly the case for women human rights defenders , who may face intersectional and complex challenges during their work . Even the application of the international human rights defenders definition and approach may pose a challenge , if it favours charismatic male leaders of formal civil rights organisations , or publicises the identity of at-risk women , for example . As a minimum , we argue that those who assist the United Nations to raise awareness of violence and rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting and promoting their agency . <p> This pandemic has retrained the international gaze to notice who are the emergency workers , who are the essential actors . During this pandemic and afterwards , human rights defenders will be taking on themselves the risk of raising up human rights violations to international notice .

They were getting free pads every month from their school . But now since all schools are closed , they are facing inaccessibility of sanitary pads . The government is not providing sanitary pads along with foodgrains or under some other schemes . These girls are completely cut off from the supply for over two months . In Delhi alone , approximately 15,000 have directly impacted due to COVID-19 lockdown in terms of the menstrual hygiene management . <p> Mr. Bagaria further said that the small manufacturing units which were producing low-cost sanitary napkins have been shut due to lockdown and the workers have moved back to their homes .

@@31865641 <h> COVID-19 : Building blocks to Ghana 's industrialisation ; Where are we now ? <h> The COVID-19 pandemic has made countries all over the world re-strategise for the immediate ( near ) future . <p> Generally , it is expected that there will be a decline in Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) of many countries . <p> Throughout history , we have learnt that disruptions ( human or natural ) result in changes in economic strength of countries . <p> While some countries maintain their economic strength , others become weaker . <p> Some economically weaker countries become stronger and other weak economies become weaker . <p> The changes in strength is not spontaneous or even entitled ( because we are not entitled to anything anyway ) ; rather , a country 's economic position is a matter of proactive strategy . <p> For many developing countries in Africa with many structural weaknesses and looking for an opportunity to turn the tables , it appears the pandemic has brought a glimmer of hope . <p> Nature has smiled on us in the midst of the pandemic and we have another chance to reduce our dependency on imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some health-related essentials in the whole world , the remedy is found locally and countries are looking for local alternatives . <p> For those who argued that the government as the biggest procuring entity could use policy to change our problematic terms of trade , they have been vindicated because we see the government awarding contracts for the production of Personal Protective Equipment ( PPEs ) , face masks , medicines , sanitisers and other health-related equipment needed to fight the pandemic to local manufacturers . <p> I dare say , and it does not take a prophet to allude , that but for the pandemic and shortages in the world over , the government would have continued in its bad ways of importing these health-related equipments from abroad . <h> The call for industrialisation <p> Successive governments agree that the way to come out of our economic problems is to industrialise . <p> Here , the call is for the establishment of import substitution industries . <p> The government initiated and is still pursuing the 1D1F policy , a policy that is commendable and , if implemented well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , we are yet to see the full benefits and real changes in respect of how it helps our terms of trade . <p> We have realised that we can produce some of the basic necessities that we need locally . <p> So even if our outflows in terms of manufactured goods can not significantly boost our prospect of surplus terms of trade , we can reduce inflows of manufactured goods through import substituting industrialisation . <p> This will make a huge difference in our international trade and finance indicators . <h> Proactivity but not reactivity <p> With the COVID-19 , we have heard the popularisation of the adage that " necessity is the mother of all inventions " . <p> We have seen prototypes of several locally developed equipment for our use in this era of pandemic . <p> Indeed , this is not the first time such local innovations have come up due to necessities . <p> In 1917 , Alfred North Whitehead argued that " the basis of invention is science , and science is almost wholly the outgrowth of pleasurable intellectual curiosity " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of innovation to necessity but seek to use scientific curiosity to proactively innovate . <p> For those suggesting that Ghanaians are innovative and hiding behind the expression that necessity is the mother of innovation , I dare say that such ideas do not fit in today 's world of innovation anymore . <p> It is not that the adage is not true , the problem is that it is a reactive strategy and not sustainable . <p> That is why we have not as a country been able to commercialise the many prototypes or inventions that we have developed over the years . <p> It worked throughout history but lately countries plan and create a need and get people to identify with the need so they make money . <p> As a nation , the need to create and innovate is forward looking and one will constantly need to monitor trends and create to survive . <p> We need to change our definition of when necessity starts to generate innovation . <p> Necessity is not entirely out of our control ; we can control and create necessity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is actually within our control . <p> So far , all our innovations have been reactive to COVID-19 . <p> The panic-fuelled reactive strategy is not going to help us in the long run because once this pandemic is over , we are likely to go back to our old ways of depending on imports . <p> This will happen because there was no long-term strategy for its sustainability . So as we come out of the pandemic , will we continue to produce our own sanitisers , PPEs among others ? If we do not have a long-term strategy , we will go back to our bad habits . <p> Those countries that are proactive in their strategies will take over once again and we will continue to follow . <p> *9The good thing is that we have discovered our sense of creativity once again . <p> This is the time to soberly reflect and redefine the content of our " import basket " . <p> Let us look deeper into the import basket and begin to define which items should be removed from it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " export basket " and consider filling them with not only primary products but value-added products . <p> This requires practical policy direction from the government . <h> The way forward <p> There is a need for targeted investment in research and development . Research and development are not things we take seriously in our public discourse . Perhaps this is because we focus too much on short-term gains . <p> As a nation we do not allocate enough resources to research and development . <p> We like to be certain about results before we proceed to invest . <p> But that is anti-innovation . As a country , what is our budget for research and development ? <p> There are no shortcuts ! The less interest in funding research activities is seen at the micro and macro levels . <p> The countries we depend on to get medical and other supplies have invested and continue to invest in research and development to get " the next big thing " to commercialise . <p> In the many industrialised countries that are constantly innovating ; research is prioritised and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Ghana , where there is investment in research , it is for short-term results . Perhaps the cure for the COVID-19 and many ailments confronting the world is in Ghana . <p> But how can we tell when we have not put our best foot forward in research ? <h> Conclusion <p> The key is openness and willingness to challenge the status quo and daring to try new things . <p> If in the past we have ever been scared to dare and try new things , then I dare say that COVID-19 has given us another opportunity to try to do things differently .

" <p> Of course , the Founding Father has many quotes that remain relevant today . But the one about preparation seems particularly prescient during the coronavirus pandemic . Examples of preparation -- and a lack of it -- are evident throughout the country as the nation struggles with an outbreak that has contributed to about 100,000 deaths . <p> Among the examples of strong preparation is a fascinating exercise undertaken by Clark County Public Health . Four years ago , the department 's Ethics Committee created a ventilator allocation plan in the event of a crisis that would stretch local capacity . <p> A 2017 project summary states : " The surge of patients requiring intensive care during an influenza pandemic could overwhelm the medical care capacity of many communities , including ours . During a pandemic , shortages of ventilators and other medical equipment could place physicians and other health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their patients . " <p> That was part of a plan that is now in the last stage of being finalized . And it appears farsighted in the midst of the pandemic . <p> Fortunately , Clark County has not been overwhelmed by a need for ventilators . Statewide stay-at-home orders have been credited with preventing hospitals from being overrun by COVID-19 patients , even as the disease has contributed to more than 1,000 deaths in Washington . But the serendipitous exercise of preparing for a pandemic has represented the ounce of prevention that can outweigh a pound of cure . <p> In the event of more patients that ventilators , a triage team of a critical care doctor or hospitalist , a critical care nurse and an ethicist would determine who has access to a ventilator .

At the federal level , that is reflected in the Trump administration 's failure to plan for and react quickly to the outbreak . <p> In 2016 , the Obama administration finalized a detailed 69-page plan for reacting to a pandemic . Critics have asserted that the Trump administration ignored that playbook ; White House officials have said they replaced it with two new response plans . <p> Even if the administration had a robust plan , it is clear it has not been followed . The Obama playbook , which is publicly available , calls for coordinated messaging from the White House , rather than the mixed messages that have been evident . It also stresses a timeline for ensuring there are adequate supplies of personal protection equipment and for working with Congress to direct necessary funding ; President Trump was months behind both benchmarks while insisting the virus " miraculously goes away .

Fraudsters call up gullible borrowers and pose as bank representatives . They inform the targets that their lenders are giving a moratorium on the loan and the borrower wo n't need to pay two EMIs , as per the Reserve Bank of India 's directives . In the process , they can trick borrowers into sharing their bank details . Once they convince the borrowers , fraudsters ask them to share the OTP ( one-time password ) by giving them the impression that the OTP is the confirmation code for availing the moratorium , when actually it is for a bank transaction that borrowers may be doing . Once the borrower shares the OTP , he loses money . <p> " There is only one rule to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share any details with anyone , " said Prashant Mali , a Mumbai-based lawyer and cybersecurity expert . <p> Experts said that these are typical social engineering frauds .

However , many fraudsters made similar UPI IDs , such as pmcares@pnb , pmcares@hdfcbank , pmcare@yesbank , pmcare@ybl , pmcares@icici , and so on , to defraud people . There were so many fake IDs that the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT-In ) also issued a warning along with banks , ministries and police departments recently . Even State Bank of India released an advisory to its customers to be cautious of fake IDs such as pmcarefund@sbi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once we came across the fake IDs , we jumped into action with partner banks in our ecosystem to act on it .

The message asks the victim to click on a link , which takes him to a fake government website . The site asks the victim to enter sensitive bank account details to avail the fund .

@@85027141 <h> Renault and Nissan rule out merger as they unveil survival plan <p> The logos of car manufacturers Renault and Nissan are seen in front of dealerships of the companies in Reims <p> By Gilles Guillaume and Naomi Tajitsu <p> PARIS/TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Renault &lt;RENA.PA&gt; , Nissan Motor Co &lt;7201 . T&gt; and Mitsubishi Motors Corp &lt;7211 . T&gt; ruled out a merger on Wednesday and doubled down on a plan to cooperate more closely on car production to save costs and salvage their troubled alliance . <p> The companies have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic just as they were trying to rework their partnership following the arrest of its chief architect , Carlos Ghosn , who had been pushing for a merger despite stiff resistance from Nissan . <p> The new plan , which entails cutting the alliance 's vehicle ranges by a fifth , pooling manufacturing by region and capitalising on joint designs , is meant to serve as a peace treaty , sources have told Reuters . <p> He also said existing ties with Germany 's Daimler &lt;DAIGn.DE&gt; , which owns Mercedes-Benz , could be strengthened and that he hoped to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nissan were among the weakest global automakers going into the coronavirus crisis and had lacked a clear plan for using their alliance to emerge from the slump and share the burden of investing in electric vehicles and other technology . <p> Rivals such as Peugeot &lt;PEUP.PA&gt; and Fiat Chrysler &lt;FCHA.MI&gt; , have been pushing ahead with plans to share costs and designs while the two biggest carmakers , Volkswagen &lt;VOWGp.DE&gt; and Toyota &lt;7203 . T&gt; , already operate as single units . <p> Renault shares , which have been depressed by the tensions with Nissan and the French carmaker 's first loss in a decade in 2019 , surged by almost 20% following Wednesday 's announcements . <p> Daimler shares jumped as much as 10% while Nissan closed 5.5% higher . <p> Renault is also on course to receive 5 billion euros ( $5.5 billion ) in French state aid although the government wants it to keep car manufacturing in France in return . <p> For a graphic on alliance profits and sales , please click on : https : //tmsnrt.rs/2zo3F6G <p> LEADER-FOLLOWER <p> Under their new plan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called leader-follower system , with one company leading for a certain type of vehicle and geography with the others piggy-backing on the designs and manufacturing . <p> Senard said that would help cut costs , with joint savings on future compact sports-utility vehicles ( SUVs ) coming to 2 billion euros ( $2.2 billion ) . <p> In Brazil , for example , the new approach means the alliance will go from making six models on four platforms - or underlying vehicle architectures - to seven models on one platform . <p> A tighter design and development process at the alliance , whose best-known cars include the Renault Clio compact hatchback , the Nissan Rogue crossover SUV and the Mitsubishi Outlander SUV , would reduce it total number of models by 20% by 2025 from well over 80 now . <p> Some analysts pointed to potential problems , however , saying the three companies remained locked in a partnership while some larger rivals were not constrained by structural limitations . <p> " The way this plan has been designed is to avoid stepping on each others ' toes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries they have to respect , " said Chris Richter , senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA . <p> Renault , Nissan and junior partner Mitsubishi , which joined the alliance in 2016 , have clashed previously due to differences in corporate cultures and opposing views over structures . <p> Renault owns 43% of Nissan while it has 15% of the French carmaker but no voting rights . Nissan has resisted proposals for a full-blown merger as executives felt Renault was not paying its fair share for the engineering work it did in Japan . <p> REGIONAL CARVE-UP <p> The strategy is a departure from Ghosn 's focus on growth and volumes that led to excess capacity . Renault and Nissan , which is set to post a net loss in its latest fiscal year , are now hoping to get ahead of rivals in areas like electric vehicles . <p> They said they aimed to produce nearly half of their vehicles under the leader-follower approach by 2025 and cut investment for those models by up to 40% . <p> Nissan will take the lead in Japan , China and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russia , South America and North Africa while Mitsubishi will lead in Southeast Asia and Oceania , the companies said . <p> They did not detail how many jobs would go as production shifts , raising fears that some plants , including Nissan 's Barcelona factory in Spain could shut . L8N2CW57D <p> Nissan and Renault are due to announce separate restructuring plans on Thursday and Friday respectively . <p> The alliance 's new production plans will also include using more common parts and designs than before . They will now use a shared design for the upper body of each company 's cars , which would then be personalised to reflect the individual brands . <p> " Today we have a much higher scope of sharing between the brands , " said Alliance General Secretary Hadi Zablit.

@@31858841 <h> Air New Zealand liquidity and 2020 earnings update <p> Air New Zealand is today providing an update on its actions to reduce cash burn , as well as earnings expectations for the 2020 financial year following the precipitous decline in demand for air travel that has resulted from the outbreak of Covid-19 . <p> Liquidity position <p> Prior to the outbreak of Covid-19 , Air New Zealand was in a strong position with a resilient balance sheet and short-term liquidity of more than $1 billion . The airline has no financial covenants on new or existing debt facilities and no significant debt maturities until 2022 . The airline has taken and will continue to take swift and decisive action to preserve and enhance liquidity and minimise cash burn . <p> As previously disclosed to the market , once the initial restrictions for international travel into New Zealand were announced in March 2020 , Air New Zealand moved quickly to secure a loan facility of up to $900 million with the New Zealand Government , to bolster liquidity and provide the airline with sufficient flexibility to respond to a range of potential demand recovery scenarios . <p> As at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately $640 million , which does not include any funds from the $900 million loan facility with the Government . <p> " We have not yet needed to draw down on the government loan facility , as we continue to utilise all available levers to reduce our cash burn and right-size the business to reflect the expectation that , for some time , our airline will be smaller than it was pre Covid-19 " says Chief Financial Officer Jeff McDowall . <p> The airline has already implemented a number of actions across every aspect of its cost base and capital expenditure portfolio , including : <p> * Labour reductions of approximately 30 percent , or 4,000 employees , which is expected to drive annualised savings of $350 to $400 million <p> * Suspension of all short-term incentive schemes for the 2020 financial year <p> * Reduction of the Executive team by 30 percent <p> * A 15 percent reduction in the salary of the Chief Executive and Executive team , together with a 15 percent reduction in Director fees through to December 2020 <p> * Institution of a hiring freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost $700 million in expected capital expenditure to December 2022 , including deferrals of planned A321 NEO deliveries <p> * Decision to ground the airline 's Boeing 777-200 and 777-300 fleet until at least the end of calendar 2020 <p> * Reductions across all other areas of the airline 's cost base including cancellation of all non-essential spend , reduction in leasing costs and modification of various vendor and supplier terms . <p> As a result of the above actions , Air New Zealand expects to reduce its average monthly cash outflows by approximately $50 million to $60 million1 for the 2021 financial year . <p> " Like all businesses at this time , we find ourselves facing an environment where revenues will be a small fraction of what we are accustomed to . Over the course of the last few months we have acted at pace to implement both short-term and structural cost saving measures to adapt to this new environment , and we will continue to seek out further opportunities to consolidate facilities , reduce capital spend , review fleet composition , supply chain costs and adjust our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for air travel will eventually rebound , so we are cognisant of striking the right balance between removing cost from the business and ensuring the airline is in a strong position to ramp up as demand recovers " says Mr McDowall . <p> 2020 Earnings update and outlook <p> The airline had a solid start to the 2020 financial year , however market conditions deteriorated dramatically in early March as the spread of Covid-19 began to extend globally . That led the airline to confirm on 9 March 2020 that it was withdrawing any full year earnings guidance . <p> " Across March and April , Air New Zealand reduced its network capacity by more than 95 percent as demand declined to almost zero following the implementation of the New Zealand government 's travel restrictions2 . The recent move to Alert Level 2 has been a welcome reprieve , allowing us to get the domestic engine turning again , however it is clear that it will take some time for demand to return to pre-Covid levels . We are preparing for a scenario in which the airline is still 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Mr McDowall . <p> For the second half of the 2020 financial year , Air New Zealand 's network capacity is expected to be approximately 50 percent lower than the prior comparative period , driven by a reduction of approximately 90 percent in the fourth quarter . In light of this and the fact there was very little revenue coming in during Alert Levels 3 and 4 , the airline is now expecting to report an underlying loss for the 2020 financial year . <p> Given there is still a high degree of uncertainty regarding demand for air travel under New Zealand 's Alert Level 2 , the period of time in which social distancing will be required on the aircraft and the timing of a shift to Alert Level 1 , the airline will not be providing specific 2020 earnings guidance at this time . <p> Other significant items <p> On 28 January , Air New Zealand provided an initial estimate of the Other Significant Items that it expected to report in its financial results for 2020 . The airline is now expecting to recognise hedge losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 . As per the airline 's update on 28 January , these items are not included in the airline 's calculation of underlying earnings for the 2020 financial year . These estimates have been updated in the table below to reflect current expectations , however , are still subject to further review by both the airline and its auditors . <p> De-designation of hedges Air New Zealand 's Group policy is to hedge up to 90 percent of its expected fuel consumption for the next three months , falling to a maximum of 30 percent after twelve months . With passenger demand at historical lows , the airline sought to maximise utilisation of aircraft by operating charter and repatriation flights , as well as deploying passenger aircraft on cargo-only missions to deliver New Zealand products to other countries and bring critical medical supplies back into the New Zealand market . Despite this , there has been a substantial reduction in overall capacity , and accordingly fuel consumption , which has resulted in fuel hedge losses for the period . These losses were partially offset by gains from closing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures which are no longer expected to occur <p> The net impact of these items for the 2020 financial year is currently estimated to be in the range of $85 million to $105 million . This amount will vary if there are significant fluctuations in fuel prices or foreign exchange rates . The airline currently has un-hedged foreign currency debt as a consequence of the de-designation of revenue hedges resulting from a decline in expected foreign currency revenues . These liabilities are subject to translation risk as the liabilities are revalued each month . Gains or losses which were previously reflected in the airline 's Cash Flow Hedge Reserve will now be reflected in the Statement of Financial Performance . Fluctuations in foreign currency rates preclude the airline from providing an estimated impact at this time , but any amount will be reported within Other Significant Items . Aircraft impairment charge Air New Zealand anticipates that global demand for international air travel will rebuild slowly . As such , the airline expects to book an impairment charge in the 2020 financial year relating to some of its Boeing 777 aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to these aircraft in the range of $350 million to $450 million , which will be partially offset by a reduction in the airline 's deferred tax liability . Assessment of the impairment charge is underway as part of the 2020 annual results process and will be reviewed by the auditors . More information will be provided when the airline releases its annual results later this year . <p> Reorganisation costs The airline had previously announced reorganisation costs in the range of $20 million to $25 million for the 2020 financial year . Following the swift decline in demand for air travel resulting from Covid19 , the airline has confirmed reductions of approximately 30 percent of its workforce , which is expected to bring the total reorganisation cost for the year to a range of $140 million to $160 million . <p> CEO commentary Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran says that the Covid-19 pandemic has had an unparalleled impact on the aviation industry , and the future landscape of the airline will look vastly different to what it does today . <p> " This is without a doubt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aviation industry , has ever faced . The implementation of domestic travel restrictions and border closures have been incredibly effective at slowing the spread of Covid-19 in a number of countries , including here in New Zealand , but they have also had a profound impact on demand for air travel . <p> " Throughout this pandemic , Air New Zealand 's focus has first and foremost been on protecting the health and safety of our customers and our team , while also taking swift and decisive action to protect the long term viability of the airline and preserve liquidity . We are doing everything in our power to ensure Air New Zealand emerges strongly from this crisis . <p> " I am extremely grateful to our team of Air New Zealanders who have remained focused on getting our business up and running again and providing the high standard of customer service and care that we are known for , through what can only be described as an extraordinarily difficult time . <p> " As we farewell a large number of our talented and immensely hard-working people from all areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thank everyone for their exceptional service to Air New Zealand . <p> " I also want to take this opportunity to thank our customers - we know it has n't been an easy time for anyone amidst this crisis .

There is no playbook for the situation we are currently facing , so we need to create our own .

@@31857841 <h> Why Is This Happening ? Calculating the cost of division with Heather McGhee : podcast and transcript <p> Chris Hayes speaks with author and political commentator Heather McGhee about how this public health crisis is shining a light on the ramifications of policies and politics rooted in the legacy of racism . <p> Why are African Americans getting hit the hardest by the coronavirus ? In part , this public health crisis is shining a light on the ramifications of policies and politics rooted in the legacy of racism . And what 's interesting , and what Heather McGhee is writing about for her upcoming book , is the way these racially motivated politics end up creating bad economic policy overall , producing a government that makes everyone worse off . <p> So while we watch scenes of people lining up for miles to get groceries from food banks and hear about unemployed Americans struggling within a broken system to receive some kind of financial relief , Heather McGhee joins to discuss the true cost of a racially divided nation . <p> Note : This is a rough transcript -- please excuse any typos . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Societies that have a public health system that is highly functioning , well coordinated and well resourced are obviously going to do better in a public health crisis . And we have resisted that in the richest country on the planet , in large part for the past 100 years because of racism . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Hello and welcome to " Why Is This Happening ? " with me , your host , Chris Hayes . Well , here I am , back in the closet for yet another week of quarantine podcasting out there in the world and I 've been thinking about , there 's sort of an interesting thing I think that 's happened in terms of the socioeconomic and racial lines of division in the country with respect to coronavirus . Two things at once . So at one level , as the data has come in , we are seeing that there are massively disproportionate effects , particularly for African Americans , but for black and brown Americans versus white Americans . <p> We 've seen this in the fatality numbers , particularly in places like New York , Louisiana , and Detroit , and there 's a bunch of reasons that contribute to that . Some of which I think were probably discussed in today 's conversation . There 's two stacked on top of each other . The fact that African Americans in the U.S. because of the long legacy of white supremacy and racism are more susceptible to a bunch of preexisting conditions that essentially compound the danger of coronavirus and also the medical care they get now , even in the hospital . There 's study after study that shows the ways in which racism and racial lenses negatively affect their treatment . So that 's one fact , right ? It 's not the great equalizer , the coronavirus . <h> Related <p> But then the other fact is that the virus does n't give a s--- what color you are and will come for you . And if you 're sitting somewhere in America being like , well that 's just happening in New Orleans , that 's just happening to black folks in Detroit . That 's just getting the people in the Bronx like no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . It 's not the way it works . If you think that , if you get lulled into thinking that , you are going to have an outbreak where you live . And the tension between those two is to me almost one of the most fundamental tensions at the heart of American politics , sociology and political economy , which is we are all in this together and yet , we are all in this together A , B , we 're not all equal , and C , the belief that some have that they can wall themselves off from those other people over there in America makes everyone worse . <p> So if you think , " You know what , we 're going to get back to work in my county because we 're not like those gross big cities that have all that density and transportation . We 're going to go back , I 'm going to go to my nail salon , I 'm going to go to my massage studio . " You are inviting an outbreak where you live based on your dumb--- , probably racist beliefs about the evil infections of your dumb--- , probably racist beliefs , about the susceptibility to infection of the big cities . And that is just a constant theme throughout , I mean it is bright as day right now , but it 's a constant theme throughout the whole history of the country . <p> And my good friend , someone who I truly admire and look up to and respect , Heather McGhee just released this Ted Talk she gave , which is basically about this thesis and it is a teaser for the book that she has written , is writing , that 's going to be coming out in 2021 called " The Sum of Us . " And it is about precisely this dynamic . It 's about the ways in which the legacy of racism and white supremacy produces a politics that produces a government that makes everyone worse off . That basically cutting off the nose to spite the face time and time and time again and never has it been more obvious than this moment right now . And so I thought it would be awesome . Also , I have n't talked to her for awhile , so I thought it 'd be an awesome quarantine conversation to talk to my buddy scholar Heather McGhee . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Hey Chris . <p> CHRIS HAYES : How are you ? <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : I mean , I personally am fine , right ? I 'm healthy as far as I know , my family is okay . Financially it 's tough , but I 'm okay . But as a citizen of this country and of this world , I 'm heartbroken . This is worse than we feared , right ? When this man walked into the White House , it was like , please do n't let anything really terrible happen on his watch . And it has and he has bungled it more than we possibly could have articulated from waiting too long , to telling people to ingest bleach today . It 's just really bad , and people are dying because of it . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Yeah . The word , I 'm glad you used the word heartbroken , because I was talking to a friend last night in a Zoom cocktail hour and I 'm going to get choked up actually right now , so I 'll just try to keep it under control . But there 's the thing with the numbers and this is such a cliche and trite observation , obviously Joseph Stalin said this years ago , but you 're looking at the numbers and it 's 50,000 dead and what does that mean ? Then , we have people in our company who we lost . We have people on staff who have lost loved ones . I have friends who have lost loved ones . The grief is everywhere . I find it very overwhelming and very upsetting and heartbreaking . I feel deep grief and mourning and sadness a lot that I 'm just wrestling with all the time . <p> CHRIS HAYES : But also that idea of what you just said is so true . The nightmare is here and it is a nightmare and I mean , I can believe and ca n't believe that we 're living through this nightmare . But the thing that , I was thinking about , remember when he did that dumb--- thing with the hurricane where he Sharpied it , he was wrong about the path and he said it was going to hit Georgia I think , and Alabama and it was n't , and then he Sharpied in the path . And I remember doing a bit on my show where it 's like this is funny and dumb but also serious and also like thank God it did n't actually get anyone killed . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . <p> CHRIS HAYES : But the stakes are really high and now it 's like here we are . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . Here we are and we have someone who after fumbling and lying and completely mishandling the situation is now firmly settled into his sweet spot of divisive politics of trying to create an us versus them within our own country and doing it really successfully , right ? I mean down to the federal government picking winners and losers with protective equipment and outbidding states and stockpiling and suggesting that they should , Florida where Donald Trump has escaped to , because New York wo n't have him anymore , has more protective equipment and ventilators than it even wanted . And you 're starting to see just this past week with a reported ban on immigration , Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education moving to make sure that dreamers do n't get any kind of aid . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : You 're starting to see a clear , racialized divide and conquer . And Mitch McConnell saying that basically blue states can go bankrupt and red states that are more rural just can open up their economies and win . This is the formula , right ? It 's shrink the circle of human concern , give the people on your team an outsized sense of security and superiority . And in fact , make them delight a little bit in that . That is heartbreaking to me as someone who cares about humanity , cares about this country , cares about our soul , right ? We are absolutely failing . And just last week , I think they 've already gotten too much attention , but of course it was shocking . There were a handful of protests where you had mostly older white folks defying the protective orders to go out and protest and they were funded by the same right wing billionaires that have funded so much of the Tea Party . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And those people are going to get sick , right ? It was supposed to be a drive by protest and they got out of their cars and they smush their faces against the Capitol building and it 's like they were literally exposing themselves to die for this bargain . And that 's what my book is about , that 's what the Ted Talk was about , is the ways that racism costs everyone in the end . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Yeah , let 's start with that phone call that I think is , in some ways was the first moment I think , or the seeds of the book . Even though you 're work had focused on this long before that phone call on C-SPAN . <p> I just posted a YouTube that someone had cut of me on a very early C-SPAN appearance in which a caller while I 'm looking into the camera says , " I just had an idea that one of the ways we can deal with garbage is put them down volcanoes and what do you think of that ? " And I was like , I had to look in the camera , that is outside my area of expertise . But I thought of that because as I was watching the President just be like , I 'm just spit balling here , but maybe we get some UV light up inside the body . I do n't know how you do that , but it took me back to that moment . But all of this by way of saying the genre of C-SPAN calls is a fascinating and multifaceted one . And you had this , you were on a C-SPAN Washington Journal and someone called in , tell me what happened . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . So I was on that live television show , which is really like radio talk shows , but on TV , and the whole visual screen is your face reacting to this person . And someone called in identified as Gary from North Carolina . And his first words were , " I 'm a white male and I 'm prejudiced . " It 's kind of like the garbage in the volcano . What do you say ? What do you do ? You know , I was on there talking about tax policy and jobs and the deficit , right ? He went on to say that he was basically afraid of black men and drugs and gangs and crime . But then he said , but I want to change and I want to know what your guest would tell me to do to become a better American . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And that got to me . And so I responded not by trying to deconstruct his bias in that way that you might , if you were really pissed at someone saying that they were so prejudiced against your people on live television . But I thanked him for being honest , and I gave him some simple tips about how he could integrate his life and unlearn the messages that he 's learned . And that clip of our exchange went viral and you know , the official count is 8 million , but we had at one point counted it up as 20 , it just keeps having a life of its own because people were surprised that a black woman would n't get angry . And they were surprise that a white man would admit his bias on national television . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : In the end , after that exchange , Gary from North Carolina and I ended up getting to know each other . And what I learned from him was many things actually . But what I learned from him was that his racism was causing him to suffer . He had acute social anxiety , a sort of moral panic , and he was the one primarily suffering from his racism and it was n't , for me it was a light bulb moment that there was a through line from the economic work that I 've done my whole career as an economic policy person working at Demos , which is a progressive think tank that I ran for four years and worked at for 16 , there was an economic argument I was making and policies I was pursuing that really taught me that you ca n't contain the fallout of racially motivated , bad economic policy decision making . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : The seminal experience of my career has been , was trying to stop the subprime mortgage crisis in the early 2000s , before it ended up creating a toxic mix of racism and greed that took down the global economy . And seeing how , if we had stopped it then , back when it was only bad mortgages going to homeowners with good credit in black and brown neighborhoods , if anybody had cared who had the power to stop it , we literally would not have had the financial crisis if it were n't for racism . So I was able to connect that through line . It caused me to go on this journey over the past two years traveling the country and making the case that racism has a cost for everyone . <p> CHRIS HAYES : That example of the financial crisis is such an astute one . And also there 's an amazing example you give that I think is like the best , which is the picture of the pool , which is so perfect about the cost to everyone . Tell the story of the pool , because it to me is like a self contained story about what the thesis is here . It works perfectly . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : So I went to Montgomery , Alabama , where there is a park in the middle of the city called Oak Park , which back in the 1930s and forties was part of a nationwide building boom of beautiful public parks . You and I , as people who are born in the 70s and 80s , we do n't really know this phenomenon , but it started in the New Deal , and then in the postwar era , these beautiful , grand swimming pools that were the heart of these communities , cities and towns all across the country . And they could hold a thousand people and they were this urban planner 's vision of classlessness , right ? The middle and upper class would all meet in their bathing suits and fall in love and get married , right ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : The one that I know the best , which I ca n't believe existed , there 's this Barton Springs in Austin , Texas , which is a natural swimming pool . It 's a natural springs and it 's built around it . And when you go there you think , " Am I in a country club ? " You 're pinching yourself that this thing exists as a public good . That no , you just go , it 's public . You go and you swim in these cool fresh springs , and everyone hangs out and it 's like , this is incredible . I ca n't believe this is a thing . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : This is now a very rare sight because for the most part , even in northern cities , those grand public pools , those resort pools were public . They were funded by taxpayer dollars and they were exclusively for whites only . And in the 1950s when civil rights groups began to advocate and litigate against this practice ... of exclusion , and the barrier started to fall down . Towns did what Montgomery , Alabama did , which was effective January 1st , 1959 . The town council voted to close the public swimming pool . Not only Chris , did they close the pool , right ? They drained the public pool . They filled it in with dirt , paved it over . They also shut down the entire parks department . They had a zoo , they had recreation centers , they had a dozen public parks . They closed it all down for a decade , and when they finally reopened it , they never rebuilt the pool . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : That , to me is what has happened to our whole country . We had a very generous social welfare system that included subsidized housing , no down payment mortgages that were backed by the federal government , the Homestead Act , the land grant college system . We had a sort of a middle class that was constructed by government policy that was the envy of the world when it was for whites only , and really for white men only . And when the movement of the 1960s opened the doors to everybody else , the doors were closed on that vision , and so we 've all been living in a stingier , drained public pool . We 've been all been living in that drained public pool where our schools are underfunded , our roads and bridges are crumbling . They get a D+ from the American Society of Civil Engineers . The world we know , right ? I mean , this is the world we know . <p> CHRIS HAYES : We 're watching , right now what we 're watching this enormous global test of state capacity that is a challenge for every government . You know , even the best government , it 's an enormous challenge for , and the U.S. is just really failing the state capacity test . I mean , in fits and starts and certain localized places being able to kind of get its act together . But on the whole , as a global test of state capacity , just how good and competent , and how administratively efficient is your state ? We are not doing that well , and that 's for everyone . Again , like it 's not that it does n't have disproportionate effects , but the general level of administrative capacity of the American state is not particularly high right now . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : That is absolutely right , and this administration also accelerated a trend , and did things specifically to put to minimize the state 's capacity to respond . Whether it was cutting the public health positions that would have been able to stop this earlier on , dismantling the chief in charge of pandemic response in the spring of 2018 , whether it was making sure that our healthcare infrastructure remained in this state for the past almost four years of seesawing between attempts to kill the Affordable Care Act , to undermine , to create work requirements on the Medicaid that we have . To fund the fights against Medicaid expansion in mostly the former Confederate states . And here 's where race comes in , again . Societies that have a public health system that is highly functioning , well coordinated and well-resourced are obviously going to do better in a public health crisis , and we have resisted that in the richest country on the planet in large part for the past 100 years because of racism . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : It was the Southern Democrats who stopped president Truman from being able to have a national health insurance plan . It was a resistance by a racially organized Republican party that stopped Obamacare from being anything like actually having a collective at its core , stopped the public option , stopped the ability to negotiate drug prices . Anything where we would have to sort of be in it together , our government has resisted . And today the states that do n't have Medicaid expansion , which means that working class people , white , black , brown , are unable to qualify for Medicaid , which means that working class people who make $10,000 a year , $12,000 , $15,000 a year , make too much money to qualify for Medicaid even though their employers have no interest in offering them healthcare . People in those dozen or so states are left without . They 're uninsured , they 're dying at higher rates and their hospitals , many of them in their rural communities are closing because they have no healthcare infrastructure . And social science research has shown that racial resentment drives white opposition to Medicaid expansion . It 's seen as a black program , and it is resisted by the majority of white people . <p> CHRIS HAYES : The most perfect example of this right now in this moment is , we did the story on the show last night , which was the unemployment system in Florida . And Rick Scott back in 2011 revamped it and made it harder , a lot like these Medicaid work requirements . And the whole politics of that is , these other people over there , they 're lazy and shiftless , they do n't want to work . So we got to prod them to work , and you know what I 'm talking about when I 'm talking about those lazy people over there . You shiftless people , we ca n't let them be on the dole . We do n't want the safety net to turn into a hammock . So Scott makes , they cut benefits down from 26 weeks , I think to 12 and it makes it the one of the most onerous systems in the entire country . <p> CHRIS HAYES : You 've got to go through all these hoops . You used to be able to sign up on the phone . Now you get on the computer , you 've got to provide this documentation . Well , lo and be-f-------hold , and I 'm sure that was smart politics at a certain moment because it 's like , " Well I 'm not unemployed . And that 's those people over there . " And then like what do you know ? Millions of Floridians are unemployed and no one can get their stuff claim . And it 's like , it 's the drained pool , in real time in the last week . Now , I 'm getting emails from viewers being like , " I ca n't get my unemployment processed because someone somewhere thought it was good politics , " and maybe in the moment was good politics to go beat up on the unemployed , with all of the racial subtext of what that is . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . That is where we are . What I 'm hopeful is that 's not where we 're going to be in six months , in a year , in two years . Because it feels to me like this is a cracking open of our society on such a fundamental level , where one of the major myths of American society , which is the myth of a hierarchy of human value , that there are just some groups of people that are inherently better than others and that the fortunes of society sort of accrue to those better groups . And so , the misfortune of people who are down on their luck , as we say it 's in some way those people deserved it , right ? The undeserving and the deserving is sort of the fulcrum of American society , and it 's always been racialized , but right now as much as Trump is trying to , and the billionaire right-wing donor class is trying to sow the seeds of division , eight , nine out of 10 people agree with the stay at home orders . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Right . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : We 're ready . People understand that something terrifying is happening . We 've watched enough apocalyptic television to be like , " Okay , this is it . This is time . " There is a sense , right ? The support for Medicare for all is at the highest level it 's ever been . It 's at majority support . You 've got support for things that were already popular , like a wealth tax and a guaranteed income , shooting up even more . You 've got Republicans saying we need a universal basic income . You 've got countries that are doing things like that , having unemployment rates that increased by a percentage and a half , as opposed to going up to 12 percent which the CBO , the Congressional Budget Office just predicted today . This is hurting too many people to continue to let our us versus them politics create an illusion of safety . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And I hope that coming on , the incredible momentum that Progressives have had at the ballot box , and an organizing led by women in the 2018 midterms , even in Wisconsin , which we thought was going to be a tragedy , not just electorally , but on a human level and still may be the latter . But you saw people brave a really evil , frankly , bargain to try to suppress the vote . You saw people say , " No , I do n't want this right-wing Trump Supreme Court justice . I want somebody who believes in the public interest . " So I 'm cautiously optimistic . I 've been wrong before by doing that , but I 'm cautiously optimistic . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Here , I want to talk a little bit about how you deal with this because I think that there 's a literature that 's built up , both analysts like yourself and also there 's been political scientists and historians . All together , there 's sort of a growing literature about this , as a descriptive matter of how American politics has worked , the fulcrum of race and the social welfare state , right ? That we know that racial resentment in Michael Tesler and other people 's work has this correlation to people that views on things that are n't explicitly about race , but essentially racial resentment becomes a sort of proxy variable to determine your views on redistribution more broadly . And that the politics of that has created the kind of much less , much weaker public sector the US has , compared to other OECD countries . Right ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : So then the question becomes , okay , what 's the way around that ? And one of the approaches , and I think this has been kind of a Bernie Sanders approach more in 2016 than I think now . I think there was some growth in his analysis . Is this kind of , can you do a kind of class first politics , a class first populism that says , " Look , put all that stuff aside , focus on the drug companies that are f------ you , and focus on the big banks because everyone hates them , and they want to raise taxes on the rich and look at all these polling . Polling on all this stuff is good . You could build a coalition that 's sort of a class first coalition that sidesteps all at racial stuff might even just say like , enough with the wokeness , use whatever words you want . " That stuff 's ancillary to what we 're trying to do here . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : It 's a class struggle . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Yeah . I think it 's not an insane idea , but I think that it 's shown its shortcomings and I 'm curious to hear your thoughts on that approach . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . That is the big question , right ? I think that that approach is naive . The way I like to picture it is white , maybe unemployed , maybe marginally employed , former worker in Wisconsin , goes to a Bernie Sanders rally , absolutely gets the full bore , colorblind economic populist argument , is psyched about it . Is like , " Yes , that makes sense . The corporations are the bad guys . It 's the politicians that are in the pockets of the corporations , and they 're the ones who have screwed us . " Does n't hear anything about race except maybe some disparities story , right , is told yes , and also brown and black people are suffering more than you , and then maybe , okay . Then gets back in his truck and turns on talk radio , and here 's the people with the loudest megaphones in society , whether it 's Fox News or conservative talk radio or the president of the United States doing an entirely racialized narrative that says it 's not the corporations that you would love to work for again , who are screwing you over . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : It 's actually these brown and black people and every public programming that you 've had , from what your parents may have joked about around the kitchen table when you were growing up , to the fact that you live in a segregated place where you never see people of color . And if you do , you know they 're on the nightly news as as criminals , all of that other programming in our highly racialized society is going to say , " Why do n't you want to be on the winning team ? These people are losers . Rich people are winners . " Why would n't you want to trade up , instead of having solidarity with people who are the perennial losers of American history ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : But I also think there 's an even more insidious version of that . So , the version of , " It 's not the corporations , it 's these people . " The thing that I think Bannon and Trump got at 2016 , which he does n't do as well without Bannon in there , but like Tucker Carlson does , is it 's actually worse than that . It 's actually the corporations are actually , they 're also the enemy , and they , and the liberals in the cities . And the academics and Hollywood , they 're all in it together . Like immigrants , basically the immigrants and the urban black people , and the intellectuals and the elites , and the corporate people that took your job . They 're all part of this weird conspiracy , this kind of woke neoliberal thing that 's there to basically tear apart America , both through trade and through culture . <p> CHRIS HAYES : That is , in some ways an even more powerful message because they 're not even saying , " Do n't be mad at the big elites with a lot of money . " They kind of are , it 's that this like the Soros conspiracy is this bizarre conspiracy of poor black folks and immigrant farm workers , and then the rich and culturally powerful . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah , that 's right . That is the 2.0 that is much , much , much harder to fight . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : The good news , is they ca n't actually do it in the payoff , right ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : No , they ca n't . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : What do they do when they get into power ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : That 's right . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : They pass the trillion dollar tax cut . <p> CHRIS HAYES : They ca n't not do it . That 's right . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : What do they do in the COVID relief bill ? They further , have all of the tax relief go 80 percent of it to millionaires , right ? <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : ... Have all of the tax relief go , 80 percent of it to millionaires , the Senate Republicans sneak that in , right ? They do a small business thing , it ends up going to big chain restaurants , right ? They ca n't not do- <p> CHRIS HAYES : They ca n't deliver on that message . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : ... what they 're supposed to do , right ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : Yep . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : But what we need is more organizing , right ? We , I think we need two things . I do think we need a race conscious , multi-racial populism that arms white people who have competing frames in their minds . We did this deep research about this at Demos with my colleagues , Ian Haney Lopez and Anat Shenker-Osorio called the " Race-Class Narrative Project " and we found that the sort of persuadable folks in the middle of were n't just like at five on the one to 10 scale between racist and not racist . It 's that they held tens and ones at the same time . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Explain what that means . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Basically , there are these competing frames that explain American politics when it comes to race and class . There 's this one frame that says the rich are rich because they 're better than us and government needs to be smaller and people of color are not doing as well because they 're not as deserving and they do n't work as hard . That 's A , right , let 's put that at one on the sort of racial resentment scale . And then on 10 , it 's the good progressive , the corporations are the ones who are rigging the rules , government needs to be in the public interest again and people of color , we need to do everything we can so that people of color have an equal shot . And the reason why there are these disparities is because government and corporations break the rules . And both of those ideas exist in the minds of the quote unquote , persuadable folks . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : The people who are not sort of ideologically , absolutely in one camp or the other . Because they 've heard both . <p> CHRIS HAYES : This is such an important point about people in the center are moderates . It 's like the persuadables are just like , sometimes have just a weird mix of extreme views . That is a very common profile for a quote unquote persuadable voter . They 're not like temperamentally moderate and in the center on a bunch of stuff , they 're just like , oh no , like 9/11 was an inside job . We should n't be in the Iraq war and also like- Wall Street is run by Soros.I 'm saying this from first person experience knocking on doors in Dane County , Wisconsin , just by the way . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : No , absolutely . Human beings oftentimes hold very competing frames in our minds . And what matters is what 's primed . And this is why the progressive narrative deficit that we have , by that I mean we just do n't have the megaphone that the right does . Whether it 's the most watched cable network , sorry Chris , being Fox News or it 's the fact that right wing radio is a behemoth that has no corollary , or it 's the fact that Donald Trump , who has the biggest social media and media attention getting ability than anyone in the world are all giving you that other frame . And so it 's just a question of priming , which we used to call organizing , right ? It 's a question of who 's in your ear , who 's holding your hand , who 's explaining the world to you day in and day out . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And so there have been moments throughout our history and in recent times of beautiful cross-racial working class solidarity . The Fight for 15 which joined adjuncts and fast food workers and janitors and home healthcare aides in an explicitly pro-humanity , pro-dignity fight for a living wage . I spent a lot of time with Fight for 15 workers and they talked about it . They said , you know what , racism has a cost for us too . Like literally a white woman that I talked to who worked at Wendy 's was like , " Racism is what the boss uses to divide us . And we would n't have had such a low minimum wage if it were n't for racism and that 's why I have a stake in ending racism . " That exists , it is possible . <p> CHRIS HAYES : But to go back ... when you talk about these frames though , just to concretize a bit because I know the whole race , class work that you guys did was really fascinating and very influential . People probably do n't realize how influential it 's been among like Democratic politicians and their staffs and campaigns . That work was seminal and it 's seeded a lot of the ways that , if you were following the campaigns , presidential primary campaign , a lot of the stuff that you were hearing were straight up articulations of some of the stuff that you and your colleagues came up with . So what does it mean ? So you got these persuadable voters and they have these different frames . <p> CHRIS HAYES : They have this kind of like , yeah , I do n't like the boss or the big corporations or those or the Wall Street fat cats . And also I think that immigrants are kind of trying to get over on me . And kind of lazy and they 're bringing all their family in and maybe taking my jobs , right ? When you talk about giving people a sort of narrative or a framework that combines these questions of race and class , what does that mean ? <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : What it means is you have to talk about race . You ca n't be silent on it because the loudest racial narrative is a divisive one for white people . But it depends on what you 're talking about . For brown people , it 's a divisive narrative around black people . For some black people , it 's a divisive narrative around brown people . Like it 's not only white people who have negative opinions about other races . <p> CHRIS HAYES : The idea that like racist demagoguery and prejudice are limited to white people , obviously as a structural fact that 's about the structural white supremacy . But if you grew up in New York , you hear all sorts of crazy s--- . All sorts of crazy negative s--- from all kinds of people about all kinds of other people , that 's a constant . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah , do n't get me started on the Punjabis . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Right , exactly , right . And then you 'd just be like , what , what , what did you ? Or just like about the Puerto Ricans and the Dominicans or this or that and it 's like , damn dude . And you would be even like hanging with a friend who you 're cool with , and then he says something about the Chinese and you 're like , bro , what , what ? But it 's like , yeah , like that stuff is in ... those narratives are being cultivated all over the place , not just for white folks . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . So you 've got to talk about race because it 's in our minds , it 's the way we think about ourselves and the world . You have to specifically talk about race . You ca n't have a colorblind economic populism or you 're not interrupting the dominant narrative . You have to explicitly call it out and explicitly call out the tool of division . And say that politicians are pointing the finger at immigrants and people of color while they pick your pocket . Say that they want us to blame other struggling families , who have the courage to move here and risk everything rather than put the blame with the corporations that gladly shipped our jobs overseas and still got big tax kickbacks . So you really do actually have to call out what Trump and the right wing are doing , so that people identify it when they get back in the car and they turn on right wing radio , right ? <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : You have to give them the tools to actually unmask the greed behind the racism . And then you need to , and this we found is particularly important for people of color actually , you need to actually remind people that working together across race , which is something that everyone is pretty hungry to do . There 's this latent desire for this division to go away . But that it 's effective and that it has won things in the past , because we 've been knocked down for so long it 's hard to see the sky . There is a serious sense of fatigue that we ca n't actually win anything that will meaningfully change our lives , if we could n't do that with Barack Obama in the office , White House for eight years , how are we going to do it for anybody less than him ? That 's really real for many people of color . So you need to actually give them hope . You need to actually remind people that we 've been able to win before and lives have been changed and things have gotten better . <p> CHRIS HAYES : I want to talk about sort of building this narrative and what it means in this moment , this moment of both crisis opportunity and also an election , right after we take this quick break . <p> CHRIS HAYES : So the race , class stuff that you did , you did see it in the mouths of a lot of candidates . Elizabeth Warren , Castro , Booker and Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders quite a bit . I mean , I actually think there was like a real evolution of the Bernie Sanders message from a much more kind of class first economic populism . That 's a side issue to a more explicit ... He had this whole thing about like they are trying to divide us . They want to divide us . They want to divide us by these ... and I thought actually that was the most effective , this sort of rhetorical sweet spot was when he was sort of leaning into that . But also , okay , so where is this message now in this whole thing , Because it 's so bizarre , right ? They 're trying to do it again , I do n't know how effective it is . <p> CHRIS HAYES : We 're in a just totally different world . While you were doing all this work on this , while I was covering the primary , the world we were in was a world of this like weird right wing populism married to corporatism , like a populous message and a corporatist policy . They 're suing to get rid of the ACA . They 're beating up on immigrants in every way they can to sort of make a spectacle of it . They go back to that whenever they get scared . The economy has got three and a half percent unemployment . The macro numbers look pretty good . Inequality is still pretty bad . Working people still struggling but doing better than they were , say eight years ago . What does that all add up to and now it 's like , I do n't know , what is it now ? I do n't know . It 's a scary new world . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : It 's a scary new world . A friend of mine said , it 's like the tide went out and you realized everybody was swimming naked . Even though those numbers were great , even though the stock market was doing great- <p> CHRIS HAYES : Great point . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : ... you still had people not actually able to pay their bills for one month if they could n't go to work . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Look at those food bank lines , that 's what that says . The food bank lines say , we have three and a half percent unemployment and a great economy a month ago , two weeks into quarantine , people need food from the food bank . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : That 's right . You had all of these businesses that actually were on such thin margins that even if they got through the hoops of all these ridiculous government programs funneled through banks , they could n't actually wait the three weeks to get it done without firing everybody . So the underlying inequality was not mitigated . The safety net was even in worse shambles than it was before . Because we continued to have stupid things like food stamp work requirements and Medicaid work requirements and the sequester , remember that ? When we did this grand bargain to just automatically chop off two percent of the budget , that 's still been going on . Public programs have been operating at a razor thin edge for so long and it 's all been revealed . The ways in which the backbone of our economy has been for two generations now , a service sector that is primarily and disproportionately women , people of color and immigrants , who now suddenly , not being the disrespected under $15 an hour workers are suddenly are essential workers . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And they 're the only people who are going outside and going to work and they 're doing so without hazard pay , without paid leave , without all the things that ... without masks and gloves and hand sanitizer . They 're working at Amazon warehouses and getting fired for speaking up while the richest person on the planet is at the head of that corporation . They do n't have anything that Ro Khanna and Elizabeth Warren 's bill that they have , the essential worker 's bill of rights , these are basic things , right ? These are not trying to make millionaires out of delivery drivers . These are things that any worker should have on a good day . And certainly the only workers who are putting themselves out on the line every single day to keep families safe and healthy and fed , of course they should have . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And yet that still has not passed Congress . And we are in a moment I think of strange bipartisan agreement in weird corners of our politics , both out in the public and with , single Republican members of Congress and senators saying things like , we should have a guaranteed income until this is all over . And yet we have the fear of God struck into the hearts of the Republican billionaire class that is really willing to let 50,000 more Americans die in order to make sure that the stock market is functioning well and that Americans do n't build a safety net right now that will stay after the pandemic is over . <p> CHRIS HAYES : That is one of the most ghoulish and gob smacking aspects in the moment . I do think sometimes , you 're talking about the protest , I do think there 's a little bit of , they have succeeded in doing a psych job in terms of like how expansive that view is . And I think they buy their own b------- a little bit to their detriment . I think they think that like there 's this hunger , a great American awakening to go out and like work in the face of a virus and maybe die in a plague . And I do n't think that 's actually why . And I also think that , actually if you even surveyed a bunch of CEOs , they 'd be like , Macy 's in Georgia is not reopening . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah , right . <p> CHRIS HAYES : They 're not idiots . But what I do think is the ideological bedrock here , which is your watching right wing restlessness with a collective communal project that is done for public safety and health , at the cost to the market and commercial life . And it drives them nuts and they hate it and they 're getting restless and they do n't want to keep doing it because commercial life ... And part of that critique , we all get , I want to go to a G------ baseball game . I want to take my daughter to the concert that I bought her tickets for . I want my brother to get married this summer . Like everybody wants all of that . A lot of it 's probably not going to happen . But these moments of weird truth-telling from like the Stephen Moore 's of the world- <p> CHRIS HAYES : Weird truth telling from the Stephen Moores of the world and these others , where it 's like , " No , no , you must offer up your body on the altar of the market of commercial life , of normalcy . " Like Chuck Grassley talking about how worried he is about the fate of the pigs that have nowhere to go because of the people getting sick in the pork processing plant . <p> CHRIS HAYES : And it 's like , " Okay bro , I get it . You represent a bunch of pig farmers and yes , it 's a problem that their pigs do n't have anywhere to go , but our area of primary concern are these sick workers in the pork processing plant . Right dude ? " And not even pretending that 's the case . Just been like , " I talked to farmers , and I 'm like , what are we going to do the pigs , what are we going to do the pigs ? " I 'm like , " I get it . That 's a real concern , but there are hundreds of people sick in these pork processing plants . " <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Gosh . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Just these moments where the sheer dehumanizing force of the ideological agenda , which is often not so explicitly stated , just keeps getting explicitly stated , and it 's so shocking to hear it so loud . You 're like , " No ... " And also not just shocking to see , but I will say this , not popular . I just do n't ... For all of the rhetorical dexterity they have and the persuasiveness and appeal of the message , which you have been talking about , go sacrifice your body for the stock market to go up , it 's like , no , the perspective is not a good one , that 's not one of their best arrows in their quiver , but that 's the one they 've been going with . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : But for black people , I have to say that message is one that our ancestors , that 's been the story of America for us . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Literally , yeah . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Literally . And so when you think , where does this come from ? Why is this being so naked and so cruel right now ? Where does this belief , particularly among people who have a lot of money , that other people 's lives are easy fodder to make more money . That does come back to the ideology of racial slavery . It does . <p> CHRIS HAYES : It 's like throw a log in the fire . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : As does the idea that you should have a minimum wage so low that someone ca n't feed their family after working all day . That same idea that the labor of some people is only valuable in as much as it provides profit to the owner class and in fact they should not gain really even just a modicum of the rewards for their labor . That idea , when you start out at zero in slavery , we 're at 7.25 now , we 've made a heck of a lot of progress in 200 years . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : We really have to reckon with an ideology that was born from gross exploitation , whether it 's colonialism or slavery , that still has some of its echoes in a way that many of the people who are justifying their social position are leading their lives today . I 'm writing a chapter , my book , " The Sum Of Us " is coming out next February , the Ted Talk , which is called " Racism Has A Cost For Everyone , " I tell these stories , I 'm still gathering more stories of course , because now I have to add something about the public health crisis that we 're in . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : One of the things that I 've been researching is , why it is that white men are the climate deniers ? If you look at why the United States is not doing more on climate change , it is basically because over the past 20 years the Republican Party has become the only political party in the world , including other conservative parties , that not only want a market based solution to climate change , but just says it 's not really happening , they do n't believe it . And what is it about that party , which is 90 percent white , and over indexes among men , and white men , that this climate denialism is so important . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And what some sociologists have found is that it comes down to something called social dominance orientation , where you actually just believe that some groups of people are better than others , and you justify your own position in society . And that means that you do n't think that something that is bad that is happening is going to affect you because you 've seen bad things not affect you before . And in fact it inflates your sense of security , gives you a false sense of security and a false lack of empathy towards people who have been suffering and are suffering . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And I think that 's exactly what 's happening right now where there 's this , " Oh wait , now it 's just people with preexisting conditions and people who are already sick and hurt . " The echoes of the healthcare crisis is like , " I do n't want the healthy people to have to pay for the sick , " as if the sick are a different species as opposed to just us before we trip and fall down the stairs . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Oh , the COVID ? <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Exactly . There 's that social Darwinism , that social dominance orientation , that is a killer . It is a killer . It is causing the planet to fundamentally shift in ways that are inhospitable to human and animal life , and in this current pandemic , it is making the " greatest country on earth , " the richest country on the earth , the worst at responding to this pandemic and protecting our own people . I do n't think Donald Trump has had a moment of grief about 50,000 people who have lost their lives on his watch . <p> CHRIS HAYES : That part of it ... And it 's not just him , because he strikes me as a person who 's genuinely , to a degree , that I find morosely fascinating , actually incapable , I think , of feeling human empathy . He 's certainly capable of displaying it genuinely , I do n't know what ... I ca n't look inside his heart but he seems to struggle with it . But the degree to which , I said this on Twitter , of the idea that you would go around after 9/11 and be like , " Well , you know the flu kills 50,000 people a year . Do you know the flu kills ... Look , we have swimming pools , we 've got car accidents , we got cigarettes . Really , I do n't get what everyone 's so sad about . " <p> CHRIS HAYES : People would have punched you in the face , you would have lost your job , you would have been spit on , and people also would have been like , " You 're a sociopath . You 're a sociopath . What the f--- is wrong with you ? " And yet here we are , people I know , our loved ones , people I work with , people that we all know , famous people , not famous people , frontline workers , cops and firefighters , MTA workers , nurses and doctors , blah blah , and it 's just like they do n't care . <p> CHRIS HAYES : They 're f------ running around telling us how many people die every year from the flu and from cigarettes , and from pools and it 's like , good God . That part of it has been so horrifying to me , and so , at a human level , heartbreaking , it 's as heartbreaking ... It 's like the grief is heartbreaking and the lack of mourning and grief and solidarity is doubly heartbreaking , where it 's like , wow , they really do n't care . They really do n't care about this calamity that 's befalling us . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : This is an invitation to solidarity . And you know that that 's the case when you see the corporations ads , which just changed and turned over in the past few weeks to all COVID-19 ads . And you have Walmart associates all singing Lean On Me into their smartphones . That 's just the message . " We 're all in it together , " is what Colgate is saying , and Tide is saying . If you wanted some weathervane as to what is the dominant narrative that Madison Avenue , as we used to call it , is hearing , is what people want to hear right now , it is that , it is solidarity , it is we are all in it together . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And I think about the mask . So we were all finally told to wear masks and our instinct is , it 's to protect ourselves , because that 's what we do , we protect ourselves , we try to put on armor and we try to shield ourselves from this dangerous thing . And what is slowly being revealed in fits and starts is that actually it 's to protect other people , which means that wearing a mask is an act of solidarity and protection to others . Even if you do n't feel sick , you should wear mask because you might get someone sick who , either because they have preexisting conditions , or because that 's just the way things happen . They could get very sick from something that has n't made you sick . <p> CHRIS HAYES : And that 's why I thought it was such a ... And I hate , I actively dislike the feeling of a mask , and I 've been wearing it for that reason and ... So there is this little , in a weird way it 's like we all have sacrificed . And I am enormously privileged and sacrificed at no level , at the level of grocery workers and nurses , but everyone , to a certain extent , has disrupted their normal lives . Again , together we have , and the mask wearing , there is a collective engagement in the public project to care for all of us together that ordinary people across the various divisions that divide our society have undertaken collectively in a way that is actually quite inspiring . <p> CHRIS HAYES : We have , Republican , Democrat , right-wingers and left-wingers , black , white and Latino , rich and poor ... Again , it does n't mean those divisions do n't matter , it does n't mean that it 's hitting everyone the same way , it clearly is n't . But as a collective innercise and collective response , there has been a remarkable amount of unity of purpose , which is why the brand- <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Because we are actually all humans , and our human bodies- <p> CHRIS HAYES : Our human bodies do n't want to die in a plague . And not only that do we not want to die on the plague , we do n't want others to die in the plague . We do n't want to pass off the plague , we do n't want to be a vector of someone 's sickness , we do n't want the infirm and immunocompromise and people in nursing homes , who we do n't know , to get sick because of us . We do n't want that . We genuinely do n't want that . And that is the hopeful part of this whole thing to me . There is just genuine decency and concern for other people 's lives that is on display everywhere . And I find that that part of it inspiring . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : It is absolutely inspiring , the tens of thousands of people who had hung up their stethoscopes years before surge back in to volunteer to go to New York . I 've had an oddly high number of friends who are doctors and nurses and public health officials , it 's the most common job of my close friends , and hearing their stories of just , " This is what the moment we were prepared for . This is the moment we were made for . " It feels like it 's an invitation to solidarity . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : I think one of the things that we 've done poorly is that we have n't given everyday people enough more to do actually , because I think that that desire to be helpful is so high right now . These were not the times that we ever knew , because we were born into Reagan and just moved on from there , but there was a time when people were buying war bonds and planting victory gardens . And there was a time when everybody was moving across the country in order to be a part of an effort that was bigger than them . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And I think that 's what we 're going to need to do . I think about the New York , you and I both live in New York , you 're from New York , I 'm from Chicago originally . But I think about the city that is going to have to be rebuilt , and just how much I would be willing to do for that , and how much I hope that our government is able to give us ways to be a part of the solution , because this country is going to have to be rebuilt . It 's going to have to mourn , which is just so crazy , the lack of mourning . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : There 's no moments of silence before these press briefings , there 's no names being read or scrolling across the top , there 's nothing , it 's like we are in a plague . Every time I open up my Facebook feed , there 's someone else 's auntie who has died . And yet there 's no public official counting of that , we need to obviously do that , and we need to roll up our sleeves . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : I think we 're going to be in a great depression , on top of the pandemic . And I just ... The public projects that came out of that period with the new deal are what are going to need to be on the horizon . I think we need to take the fact that fossil fuels are trading at so low and actually have the government buy them , not bail them out , but buy them . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Buy and shut them down . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Buy them and shut them down and- <p> CHRIS HAYES : Just keep the workers . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And keep the workers and retrain them , and let 's save the planet . Let 's actually act like the greatest country in the world . <p> CHRIS HAYES : We 've got to think big . Heather McGee is a senior distinguished fellow at Demos .

@@31857441 <p> The new-look National Party this week has to start telling New Zealanders exactly how it would lead the country 's economic recovery . <p> It urgently needs to come out with something - one economic policy - to avoid discrediting its entire campaign , centred on rebuilding " the economy you live in ... not the economy the bureaucracy talks about " . <p> Press gallery journalists are feasting on the fresh meat that is Todd Muller . His straight-shooting approach is what makes him the guy you want at your BBQ , but it 's also what makes him susceptible to being baited by journalists fishing for news . <p> Five days , two unwanted controversies <p> Since becoming leader , he has made more headlines for having a " Make America Great Again " hat displayed in his office , alongside a Hilary Clinton badge , than he has for anything economically-related . <p> Just as the white supremacy hat saga subsided , Muller found himself in hot water for the lack of ethnic diversity on his front bench . <p> Grilled by journalists on Tuesday morning for only having two Maori MPs in his shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new deputy Nikki Kaye made matters worse by adding Paul Goldsmith to the list , saying he has Ngati Porou connections . Muller ran with this . <p> While the duo was talking to one cluster of journalists , Goldsmith told another , " I have Maori connections , but I 'm not Maori myself " . <p> Minutes later , journalists asked Bennett how she felt about the new leadership holding up Goldsmith as a Maori representative . She laughed and snapped , " Paul ? ! Ok , right . They 're running the show now , so they can answer to it . " <p> This is golden TV montage material . <p> Bennett 's decision to not only make no attempt to salvage her colleagues , but emphasise their blunder , means the other narrative behind the story is that divisions in the party are raw and ugly . <p> Some will look at these situations and think , ' The desperate media is creating a storm in a teacup ' . Others will see them as speaking to Muller 's principles and character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National wants it . <p> Personality politics not an option <p> The new-look party knows it needs to avoid turning the election campaign into a ' Todd vs . Jacinda show ' . It 's aware it 'll lose a battle fought on personality politics . <p> Muller has repeatedly referred to National as being a " team of 55 " , pitting it against Labour , which has " three heavy lifters and 17 empty chairs " . <p> He will draw on the experienced strong performers in his party - Kaye , Amy Adams and Judith Collins - as well as his ambitious supporters , now holding key portfolios - Nicola Willis and Chris Bishop . <p> Labour on the other hand , will continue keeping the spotlight on Ardern and Grant Robertson . <p> In emphasising the strength of National 's " team " , supposedly unified by a leader with a track record of finding common ground among people , National 's focus will have to be on policy . <p> Indeed , Muller in his first speech as leader , had a go at Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition for opposition 's sake . We 're all tired of that kind of politics . I 'm about ideas that get results . " <p> He said his " absolute focus " was New Zealand 's economic recovery , pledging to be the right person to lead this with a corporate background at Fonterra , Zespri and Apata . <p> " I 've run businesses . I can read a balance sheet and a profit and loss account . I can tell a good one from a bad one , " he said . <p> Like Robertson , he said he did n't want to see " austerity " and would n't commit to tax changes . He could n't say how much debt was appropriate , but emphasised the need for quality spend - all stuff we 've heard before . <p> Pushed by interest.co.nz on Tuesday on his performance , and asked when he would release the first iteration of his economic recovery plan , Muller said : " This is day five ... I wo n't be standing here in four weeks with you still asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an absolute priority for us . And yes , we will phase our responses as you would expect us to . " <p> During his first question time in parliament as leader , Muller quizzed Ardern on why she had n't given businesses affected by COVID-19 cash payments , arguing the wage subsidy was essentially a payment to workers . <p> Muller has not however come out with a policy saying which businesses National would give cash to , how this would work , how much it would cost , etc . <p> It three weeks ago released a policy suggesting the Government gives small businesses cash refunds of up to $100,000 based on the GST paid in the six months to January 2020 . It proposed that if a business paid more than $100,000 over that period , they could claim up to an additional $250,000 as a repayable loan over five years . <p> Little room to manoeuvre in the battle for the centre <p> One can appreciate Muller is only just getting his feet under the table and needs to consult his caucus before coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the extent of the COVID-19 fallout that it 's impossible to plan too far ahead . A policy that might seem logical today , could be inappropriate in six months ' time . <p> And with Robertson being relatively conservative and constrained by NZ First , there is n't a whole lot of scope for National to differentiate itself when it comes to policy . What 's more , both National and Labour are yet again fighting for centrist votes , preventing them from campaigning on anything too radical . <p> But if you 're Muller , and you want to take the prime ministership off one of the most popular leaders in the world , who 's led an effort to nearly stamp out COVID-19 , you need some serious ammunition . <p> Hoping that come September 19 , the reality of job losses will be biting and people will be looking to the party that got the country through the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and 2011/12 Canterbury earthquakes for change , wo n't be enough . <p> National needs an exceptional economic recovery plan . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan this week . But in the absence of phase one , all National has in the eyes of the public is a seemingly smart and decent leader of a divided party , who 's getting smashed for his lack of political nous . <p> Muller needs to give himself something substantive to talk about , as he introduces himself to the country and tries to build a brand .

Steal a march ! Given recent outpourings we all understand the government needs to increase its revenue markedly . The tax take most certainly will play the major role . The people of NZ are entitled to know what lies in store over the next three years at least , and how it will affect them . National claim to be the party of economic prowess , they continually promote they are better equipped than Labour to lead the recovery . Therefore , put a clear , coherent and viable plan of their proposed tax regime on the table as early as possible for the electorate to digest , approve and vote on . <p> ' The tax take most certainly will play the major role ' ... will it though ?

There was a great deal of tax restructuring left on the shelf by the untimely and ungrateful 2009 defeat of the Clark/Cullen lot . Is that now to be dusted off under the smokescreen of the impact of CV19 ? The electorate got wind of it prior to the last election causing an eleventh hour U turn by the Labour hierarchy .

Latest treasury predictions looking too optimistic . At the time of that announcement it was not difficult to digest them with quite some skepticism . In times of uncertainty it is beholden on governments to provide certainty to their people . Elderly are now finding earnings from savings becoming meaningless .

I assume this election is forgone but it all feels like a healthier tone is soon to come from national . More accepting of liberal social policy like gay rights and the environment .

Comparisons are pointless unless you look at all aspects . <p> They are not actually socialist , they are capitalist countries , they have free markets and the means of production are almost entirely private . But i understand what you mean , however redistribution and social institutions tend to deliver low crime and very happy populations.https : **27;425;TOOLONG ... Essentially mixed economies , best of which understand what socialism does best and what capitalism does best and operates with parts of both . The biggest issue we have is the political to-ing and fro-ing over what should be done by the collective and what should be left to the individual . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that left leaning , capitalist ( non crony ) governments seem to get the best outcomes both in terms of wellbeing and economy . It 's hard to know why this is n't common knowledge . The US says it all ; such natural and historical advantages yet they seem to be stuck in the past and going backwards very quickly . <p> The sole reason the US went backwards under Obama is he pushed socialist policies such as Obamacare- sort of an NHS style system . Trump is fixing all of that . Also most of these European countries are slowly going bankrupt - take a good look at Sweden . <p> Depends who you are calling socialist ( I would argue it 's a scale not a Boolean ) . If you mean the NZ Labour Party , what about those 9 years where Clark and Cullen managed a thriving economy and paid back loads of debt , or this Labour Party that put us into Lockdown which many ( including myself ) considered an overreaction yet now looks to be allowing us to go back to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtaxed using the tailwinds of global growth - then blew it all at the end with a massive reversal and spending splurge which Key inherited and would have bankrupted us in 5 years if not stopped . <p> After lambasting Working for Families as " communism by stealth " National only kept on maintaining and increasing this communism , as well as communist redistribution of subsidies to property investors . ( I use " communism " in the Facebook / John Key sense here , i.e. where muppets apply it broadly to anything the government is doing that they do n't like . ) <p> Having watched Todd Muller in the House this afternoon , Ardren has it all over him . As with his predecessor , she not only answers the question put to her but also the next question her opponent will ask before he asks it ; and yet he still does ! Surely , a skilled politician would have the nouse to say something like " You 've touched on XYZ , but what does the Prime Minister say to ABC ? " If we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not likely from what I saw today . More like Simon Bridges 2.0 .... <p> This is the first of the no doubt many to come clickbait journalist urgings for Muller to come out with policy quickly . Which is exactly what he ought not to . Any one with senior executive experience knows that the midst of a rapidly evolving existential threat is not the time to be setting up ponderous Ardern style committees to develop policy . Credibility and depth to best steer us through the monster storm bearing down is what will focus voters minds . Flashy talkers in front of the camera but who do n't have a team with depth behind them will be undone when grim reality stalks mid NZ suburbia . <p> Difficult choice with 40,000 kiwis repatriating , no chance to quarantine all of them . In the end she made the right decision . Either way there were costs . In the end , having faith in the majority self isolating and doing the right thing was borne out . <p> Obviously let the kiwis in but she did little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver food and support to mandatory home isolation of returning kiwis . That 's my flavor of not losing 10B . <p> For me the election is all about jobs - and most particular job creation opportunities . Government needs to get into employing people in a big way - by establishing a few SOEs . <p> We 've got raw wool we ca n't sell - so put a shovel into the ground now and establish a major production facility . Make wool garments , rugs and blankets affordable again . Set our NZ designers onto the task of creating patterns , translate them to hand knitting - teach knitting free in all the community centres around New Zealand . <p> Then we 've got thousands of Kauri trees that will never recover from Kauri dieback . They need to be logged and processed . Again , build the plant as an SOE and model our own version of a NZ Ikea . <p> Then there is hemp and hemp product production . Again , money needs to be spent on processing facilities . If they are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing . <p> What I think every government aspirant needs to be is unafraid of setting up the businesses and becoming the employer . The current PGF funding model is n't what is needed as they look for councils and others to ' match ' funding . No time for that - we just need new industries to be established with haste . <p> We 're all going to be affected by unemployment - jobs , jobs , jobs needed and the government is best placed to take on the capital risk at this moment in history . <p> I do n't think SOEs are necessarily the way forward but I do believe that barriers which encourage production in the country are a sensible measure . We have to start producing " stuff " and creating jobs not dependent on construction . <p> They are certainly one model . During the GFC we saw a lot of stakes taken in financial institutions in the UK and elsewhere . In the Asia FC we saw Hong Kong buying a huge chunk of listed equity ( albeit as a by product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The issue I suppose with SoE is that noone has any skin in the game . Whilst it 's not an ideal solution I 'd prefer to see private entrepreneurs building businesses with govt help . <p> My point was this governments dire record in direct enterprise management and oversight . I agree with you and Kate that in this rare set of circumstances governments must assume capital risk as if they do n't the necessary big projects wo n't happen . But for the short term only . SOEs have proven poor long run capital managers with the increased return on just 51% of the power generators equity vs previous full ownership an example . They also have a lousy record at picking winners . Even unfettered Shane Jones struggles to identify projects worthy enough to burnish his political ambitions . How proponents of more direct state involvement believe a low productivity bureaucracy will somehow magically transform overnight to Roosevelt new dealers and outshane Shane , is fascinating . A NZ resurrection of the polish shipyard syndrome is inevitable if the Twyfords of this world believe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government equity ownership is unavoidable but creating new government managed enterprise just to soak up labour will deliver a 2020 version of the fun 1930s sugar bag days . Robertson is trying to give business low interest loans without much success because banks as gatekeepers have already set their debt covenants with their customers and additional state subsidised money would ratchet up the risk profile of existing loans . Other methods must be found to get the banks on board as they are the only institutions equipped to pick the winners and manage the risk . <p> One of the key reasons Kiwibuild has n't worked is because the houses were built by private sector developers who NEED a profit margin ( typically 20-30% ) . If the government is the ' developer ' , but they use private sector builders , then the govt obviously does n't need to make a profit . Those 630K 3 bedroom townhouses , then become 480-500K ... And wham ! The programme works , because the dwellings are actually much closer to some semblance of ' affordability ' ... Not rocket science ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers disappear . Most of the jobs are in the design and construction anyway . Most of them are struggling at those lower price points anyway . No policy is without it 's costs . <p> I 'd prefer to see private entrepreneurs building businesses with govt help . <p> That makes no sense as then the profits of the taxpayers help are fully privatised . And all the people who work for the SOE have skin in the game - that being their ongoing employment . Same as hospitals and schools - teachers , nurses and all other employees are very invested in getting good outcomes for the public . <p> Sure you could structure along the lines of Crown Fibre Holdings - but not so sure the public actually got much of the benefit - no cost of capital during the build out and an $11m discount on sale to one of the consortium partners ; <p> In this case there were specific technical jobs with specific expertise existing in the market - so the model you suggest made sense . It could be a very good model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selectively mill the kauri , for example . <p> But in creating new manufacturing jobs in the economy on a large scale - much of the training ( as machinists , etc ) will need to be from the ground up . Therefore , full Crown ownership makes sense . <p> What government startups are you referring to - then I can explain to you why they might have failed . <p> Most of the SOEs I can think of are still going strong or sold off to raise cash for the government . Solid Energy being an exception ( extreme head office largesse ) but from what I saw , the nail in the coffin for them was John Key deciding they had to purchase the assets of Pike River . <p> Agree with you Kate about using our resources but think we should use smart technology .

Loves it , good pay , company car , phone , laptop . Essential worker and well looked after . I think NZ lacks innovation and thinking outside the square and we are not very good at looking after our young and give them room to fly . Too much focus on short term profit vs potential in my opinion . <p> And you are so right - with a degree like hers she should have had more than ample opportunities in New Zealand - but our problem is our private sector entrepreneurs are n't textile goods manufacturing oriented - more software , entertainment , graphics , architecture , etc. oriented . <p> The government needs to get involved in building our manufacturing sector/capability for a whole lot of reasons ... not the least of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm guessing he will want to open the borders as quickly as possible to man dads business ... <p> Apata , Muller left his role at Zespri to take up the position of CEO at Apata Ltd in January 2006. 6 Apata , a Bay of Plenty company specialising in post-harvest operations , was founded by his father and others in 1983https : **26;454;TOOLONG MALAYSIA RSE Applications for the 2020 season are now open .

Teresa Ruiz ( D-Essex ) is sponsoring a bill that would overhaul the state 's main welfare program , Work First New Jersey . <p> Several measures that are meant to address individuals ' financial needs due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were advanced by a New Jersey Assembly committee Thursday . But with some of the bills calling for a state appropriation , their future is unclear . <p> Last Monday , Gov . Phil Murphy vetoed five of eight bills that sought to spend state money to help needy individuals , students and food banks and in all cases cited the state 's " dire " financial situation as the reason for his absolute vetoes . Murphy has repeatedly declined to provide specifics about the state 's budget situation but wants to borrow money to shore up finances . <p> Such sentiment may not bode well for at least two of the measures seeking to provide a combined $125 million in emergency relief to individuals that the Assembly Commerce and Economic Development Committee approved Thursday in the first ever videoconference of a state legislative committee . The meeting was noteworthy not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans vocalized their objections to measures the Democratic-controlled Legislature has been advancing to provide assistance to New Jerseyans . <h> Emergency rental assistance <p> The more expensive of those bills ( A-3956/S-2332 ) would create a $100 million emergency rental assistance program for those who have lost income due to the viral outbreak and closure of most businesses in the state . The bill 's sponsors are hoping that a provision requiring the state to use federal emergency assistance funding before a general state appropriation will make the measure more palatable to Murphy . <p> Tenants with incomes of up to 120% of an area 's median income -- which for affordable housing purposes ranges as high as $82,810 for an individual in Hunterdon , Middlesex and Somerset counties -- and who are at least 30 days past due on paying rent would be eligible .

" <h> Looking to revise welfare program <p> The other bill with a price tag ( A-3905 ) would spend $17 million -- reduced from $25 million in the original bill -- in revising the state 's main welfare program , Work First New Jersey ( WFNJ ) , although that money would come from general state revenues . Last Monday , Murphy vetoed A-3858 , which had sought to issue supplemental cash payments to WFNJ recipients , despite saying he shared the sponsors ' " concerns for the well-being of those in need " because of its likely high , though unspecified , cost . <p> Most importantly , and expensively , it would increase Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ( TANF ) benefits to provide a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently , a family of three gets $559 a month , which is just 31% of poverty . Additionally , the bill would expand eligibility to include college students and immigrants not currently able to collect , update acceptable work requirements to include classes , training and internships , expand reasons why recipients can be excused from meeting requirements due to health or safety considerations . It would also prevent the current public health emergency from counting toward the time limit recipients have to comply with work requirements . <p> Raymond Castro , director of health policy at the progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective , said the bill embodies a number of reforms recommended by a recent report that " identified many disturbing policies that destabilize families , discourage work and perpetuate , rather than alleviate , poverty . " <p> Such arguments did n't sway Assemblyman Robert Auth ( R-Bergen ) , who cast one of two " no " votes . <p> " I have so many constituents that are in jeopardy of losing their homes during this right now and their concerns have n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody bear a little bit of the burden . " <h> Long-term economic benefits ? <p> But Senator Teresa Ruiz ( D-Essex ) , a sponsor of the Senate version of the bill , said overhauling the program would help people get jobs and get out of poverty , which would ultimately improve the state as a whole . <p> " Our public assistance programs must be focused on lifting individuals out of poverty , placing them on a path towards self-sustainability and ensuring a smooth transition as they shift towards independence , " she said . " The changes approved today will do just that , making the Work First New Jersey program more accessible and allowing it to better serve our state 's most vulnerable by placing a greater focus on improving long term financial stability . " <p> The bill has already cleared the state Senate and could get final approval from the Assembly as early as next week . <p> A third bill passed by the committee ( A-3908 ) is meant to provide New Jerseyans with some measure of protection from creditors and from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medical creditors and debt collectors to take certain legal actions -- seizing a bank account or garnishing wages , for instance -- against an individual for 180 days after the first medical bill has been sent . The measure would also prevent a consumer report or credit-scoring model from considering an individual 's adverse financial situation due to the COVID-19 emergency as a negative factor in determining whether to grant credit if the person has alerted a consumer reporting agency of loss of income . <p> " With the most recent labor report revealing that about one in 10 New Jerseyans is filing for unemployment , it is abundantly clear residents are struggling , " said Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds-Jackson ( D-Mercer ) , a bill sponsor . " Making ends meet right now is a daily fight and often a decision between putting food on the table and paying bills . Ensuring there are no long-term consequences for an inability to meet certain financial obligations , so people can focus on providing for themselves and their families first , is what we must do . " <p> But an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped important provisions -- such as protecting individuals from all debt collection procedures , rather than just medical debt collections -- out of the measure when it amended the bill . Beverly Brown Ruggia urged the full Assembly to restore the protections . <p> " Last minute amendments that favor debt collectors and corporate interests have stripped this bill of many vital financial protections consumers desperately need during this pandemic , " Ruggia said . " Instead of ensuring relief and stability , the legislation as it stands will leave millions of New Jerseyans right where they have been for two months : vulnerable , financially insecure and scared .

@@71924441 <p> The nationwide lockdown posed a grim reality for the working class population , especially those who come under the informal sector and depend on daily wages . I intend to highlight an aspect of which I came across this morning . <p> There is an Amma Canteen situated a little distance from my place which serves the locality of Kandanchavadi in Chennai . I have seen thin to moderate crowds in the canteen since the day it was opened a couple of years ago . But today , during one of my essential trips to the grocery shop during this time of lockdown , I witnessed a large crowd gathered outside the canteen . <p> It was a little surprising for me , as I used to pass by this place and till date I had never seen a crowd like this . That said , people were standing patiently in a well organised queue , maintaining distance . <p> It was well beyond 9 in the morning but I was curious and decided to initiate a conversation with someone who was just exiting the canteen after finishing his breakfast . <p> Vanakkam I said , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized that he does n't understand Tamil . He was a migrant labourer from Bihar working in the construction of the World Trade Centre tower nearby . <p> I 'd studied in Delhi and knew basic Hindi , because of which I was able to have a conversation in a language we both understand ( much to his surprise ) . <p> He told me that he was forced out of work due to the sudden lockdown imposed by the Government as the construction of the towers came to a halt . There were many like him who did n't have the means to return back home and decided to stay back here ( sealed borders and the suspension of public transport including trains played a role ) . <p> They were fortunate to have these Amma Canteens which have been a lifesaver for people like him who depend on the food served here daily since the lockdown was imposed . My conversation with him ended there after he received a phone call , probably from his family back home in Bihar . I 'd forgotten to ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the conversation , which seemed incomplete . I had a lot of questions on my mind . <p> I remember watching a news report on a TV channel where a reporter on the spot was witness to people walking home in large numbers . Sticking a mike in the face of a migrant worker walking back to his hometown from New Delhi , the reporter asked why - when there was a strict nationwide lockdown - was there a need to walk such a large distance back home ? <p> The migrant worker exclaimed : " I 'd rather die of the disease than hunger " . <p> And hence , the ever so important question of providing food to the marginalized in times of a crisis like this comes up . It is perhaps too late for governments to realize now that the availability of food to the poor in times of crisis should be the priority if they really want to practice total lockdown in its truest terms . <p> What prompts these long journeys on foot ? The scenario is going to be the same once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or money . But at least the thought of getting food will provide some relief ( thanks to their local PDS ration cards which can guarantee them rations at subsidized rates ) , and perhaps - a network of family that will help each other get by . <p> But for those still stuck in cities , Amma Canteens provide respite - as they serve food to the urban poor - the working class and daily wage employees who have been left without work , shelter or food because of the lockdown . <p> It is worth noting here that the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu , J.Jayalalithaa had stormed back to power in the 2011 Assembly Elections thanks to her populist schemes such as the Amma Unavagam ( Amma Canteen ) . This initiative secured her the support of daily wage earners as they were the biggest benefactors of this scheme . <p> The Amma Unavagam promised Idly for ? 1 , Pongal ( Khichdi ) for ? 5 , Sambar rice , Lemon rice for ? 5 and Curd rice for ? 3 . And till date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The scheme had become so popular that many of the State Governments started to take a serious note of it . The Congress government in Karnataka ( 2013 ) was quick to follow and came up with Indira Canteen with the same concept of serving subsidized food to the poor and soon enough the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh also implemented the same idea in their states with different names . <p> In fact the CM of Tamil Nadu , Mr. Palanisamy in his recent presser claimed that his government is ready to open more Canteens and serve meals to many more people , in light of the present scenario . It has been reported that there 's an increase of 30% of people eating at the Amma Unavagam during this period of lockdown . <p> I must say that the scheme of Amma Canteens is a boon to many people like the gentleman I met in the morning . Perhaps Jayalalithaa was a visionary and way ahead of her time by ensuring the opening up of Amma Canteens which now cater to people from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . And not to forget the Shiv Bhojan Thali which was started on a pilot basis in Maharashtra ( by the Uddhav Thackeray government ) with a price of ? 10 for a lunch thali . It has since then halved its price during this time of lockdown . <p> Amma Unavagam and many such canteens in other parts of the country have indeed become saviors for many in such tumultuous times .

@@51607441 <h> Guo Ding and Kenny Zhang : B.C. must do more testing and urge more use of masks in public to defeat the coronavirus <p> Before mid-March , British Columbia might have been considered lucky to some extent , considering the total number of COVID-19 cases and daily increase in new infections in Italy and Spain . More recently , there have been sharper rises in Quebec and Ontario in comparison to our province . <p> The relatively low number of reported cases and a flattening of the curve of newly added cases in B.C. can be attributed to a number of factors . <p> Voluntary self-isolation has proven to be essential in preventing community transmission in the early days . <p> When federal and provincial health authorities repeatedly gave low-risk assessments of COVID-19 's threaten to Canadians before mid-March , Asian Canadians wasted no time to stay on high alert to prevent the community spread of the disease . <p> Many B.C. residents placed themselves in a voluntary self-isolation for 14 days after returning from overseas . As of March 9 , Canada had only nine cases among those who had reported recent travel history in China or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 77 then confirmed cases . Those numbers had shown no growth since February 23 . <p> Practising social distancing is more than just keeping two meters apart . <p> When Canada followed the World Health Organization 's advice to keep our border unlocked to international travellers , the Chinese Canadian community started practising social distancing in an innovative way . A group of volunteers was organized to provide pick-up services to passengers who were returning from international trips to avoid their use of public transit , taxis or ride-sharing services like Uber . <p> These volunteers installed a separation barrier in their vehicle between the driver and passenger , and kept their vehicles constantly sterilized . These volunteers also helped deliver groceries to the doors of those who were in self-isolation . <p> Self-isolating and social distancing did n't stop cross-community care and support .

For instance , on March 16 the provincial health officer limited the number of people allowed to gather at 50 , whereas other provinces have set it at zero or two . <p> Dr. Bonnie Henry also insisted for quite a while that wearing a mask did n't help prevent transmission of the virus , while many other jurisdictions made it mandatory to wear a mask in a public space . <p> The most worrisome is that there is no test for those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these individuals may not be aware that they are possible mobile infection sources putting their family and community at high risk . <p> Recent repeated community deaths of the aged rang an alarm of the failure of the current approach , which still offers no test to those individuals with none or minor symptoms . <p> To continue the early luck , B.C. ca n't afford to miss two more critical measures before a vaccine or a specific anti-COVID-19 medicine becomes available . <p> The province should encourage all British Columbians to wear a mask in the public spaces and test , test and test as the WHO advises . <p> Wearing a mask in public might not seem normal for those who grew up in western society . Unfortunately , the reality is that we are all in an unprecedented moment and many jurisdictions in Asia and Europe have shown strong evidence that wearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission of the virus . <p> As we make our health-care workers the priority , the general public should also be prepared to wear masks when possible . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases -- i.e. , screening and then enabling streaming those who are seriously ill , with mild symptoms . or with no symptoms at all . <p> While our existing hospital system is still able to handle and focus on those patients in critical condition , temporary field hospitals should be open to accept patients with mild symptoms . <p> In the meantime , those infected who have not seen symptoms should be placed in restrictive self-isolation to stop the spread to their family and community . <p> Better late than never .

The camp is perhaps the first Jewish camp in the country to announce , in detail , how it plans to open . ( Courtesy of Camp Modin ) <p> ( JTA ) -- Here 's a story that would have been unremarkable until just a few months ago : A Jewish camp is planning to open this summer . <p> Camp Modin in Maine has announced that it will open July 9 -- two weeks later than originally planned -- despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic . And it has set out a detailed plan to make it happen . <p> " COVID is something that 's going to be with us for the foreseeable future , " said Howard Salzberg , the camp 's co-director with his wife , Lisa Wulkan Salzberg . " The children have lost in-person learning and they have lost art and they have lost sports and being part of a team . How long is that acceptable for children ? We felt we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to normalcy and to mitigate the risk as best we can . " <p> Dozens of Jewish summer camps across the country have announced that they will not be running this year because of the danger of spreading the disease and the challenge of navigating murky regulations . But Maine has allowed overnight camps to open beginning July 1 and plans to release detailed instructions for them on May 20 , and other camps in the state have also said they will open . <p> Modin is perhaps the first Jewish camp to tell parents definitively that it will open , and to specifically describe how it will keep campers and counselors safe . <p> Modin plans to test every camper for the disease via at-home test kits before they arrive , and again throughout the summer . The camp has consulted on its measures with epidemiologists and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and will expand its medical staff this summer . And it has laid out a list of measures aimed at ensuring campers ' safety -- from abolishing a buffet line for meals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday said the camp relied on " facts not emotion " while making the decision , and said the disease " does not adversely affect children and young healthy adults .

" Staff will be there and wo n't be leaving the camp . They wo n't be leaving the camp to do outside activities , so everything will be happening at camp .

It was founded nearly a century ago and serves kids aged 7 to 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , but this summer will have a five-week session and , within that , a 3 1/2-week session . Modin serves around 300 campers each summer -- a number that Salzberg said will stay the same this year . <p> The camp 's decision runs counter to those made by large American Jewish camp networks , which have announced -- or are in the process of announcing -- summer cancellations either because their states do not allow them to open or they are afraid that the coronavirus will spread in their camps and endanger campers , staff and others . <p> Modin 's list of measures to ensure those things do n't happen include holding campwide gatherings in large open areas , where groups of campers can socially distance ; serving meals table by table rather than having campers line up at a buffet ; using only disposable plates and silverware ; and closing communal bathrooms . <p> Staff will be tested before they arrive and will be at camp " well in advance of the campers , " according to the email to parents . <p> The email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight arranged by the camp , whereupon camp staff would pick them up at the airport . Should parents drive their kids to camp , they will have to drop them off at a staging area outside the camp gates . Buses or vans will be available only from the nearby city of Boston . International staff also will be working at the camp . <p> Also , the email said the camp would consider sticking to bunk activities for the summer and smaller outings as opposed to full camp trips to outside locations like an amusement park . <p> Is social distancing possible in the freewheeling atmosphere of camp ? <p> Salzberg said that kids would be safer in the contained environment of camp than they would be running around a public park or beach . Even so , he said , the camp will have to impress on kids that they ca n't be nearly as uninhibited as they are in a normal year , and will have to emphasize that no plan is foolproof . <p> " We have said to families , no matter what procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Salzberg said . " You 're going to have to have an understanding with your campers and staff that it 's going to be a different summer . I do n't think there 's a parent that can guarantee you that their child , from now until they go back to school , there 's going to be no slip-ups . " <p> Salzberg added that if everyone tests negative for COVID-19 multiple times after a few weeks , the rules could be relaxed . He even floated the idea of a socially distanced bar mitzvah party for the kids who had to celebrate the coming-of-age ceremony virtually this year . <p> The camp has managed outbreaks of other diseases in the past , Salzberg said . Most recently , in 2009 , more than 130 Modin campers were infected with swine flu .

Still , she told Salzberg that she was coming back . <p> " We 're the ones that took the risk on opening , " Salzberg said of the older staff members .

In a stark change in tone from his previous speeches in which he declared " war " on the virus , Macron struck a more reassuring note , seemingly finding inspiration from the address British Queen Elizabeth II gave on April 5 . " We will have better days , we will know happy days again , " he said . Rym Momtaz explains the measures -- and Macron 's new , softer approach . <p> GOOD MORNING . Before we delve further into the details of Europe 's lockdown exit strategies , take a few minutes to read this moving op-ed by Anna Lyons , an end-of-life practitioner . Rules imposed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in hospitals have meant thousands of patients , including children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacceptable to risk more lives , " she writes , but " those closest to the people who are dying are not just ' visitors . ' " <h> TEAM VDL GIVES IT ANOTHER SHOT <p> IT 'S BACK : After a false start , the European Commission has now reworked its strategy for how the EU can develop joint or comparable criteria for exiting the lockdowns in place in various forms around the bloc -- slowly , gradually , cautiously , adapted to different local requirements , and yet against the wishes of some governments . <p> Spot the difference : The document 's currently titled " European Roadmap towards lifting COVID-19 containment measures , " two EU diplomats told Playbook ; last week , it was still a roadmap " towards exiting the COVID-19 pandemic . " The change was designed to reflect an even more cautious approach , which governments urged the Commission to take . An EU official and the two diplomats told Playbook they expect the new draft will be sent to delegations today . <p> Forbidden words : Almost every mention of an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's more " can " and " could , " and less " will " or " should . " Otherwise , the current version of the hottest thing in town is unchanged . <p> What 's still in it : The Commission 's aim is to issue guidance for EU governments saying that any loosening of confinement should be " gradual " and measures concerning a large number of people -- i.e. a general lockdown -- " should progressively be replaced by targeted ones . " That means the " most vulnerable groups ( e.g. the elderly ) would be protected for longer " and those who have tested positive to the coronavirus " would remain quarantined . " <p> Next steps : Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is expected to hold a press conference on the issue on Wednesday . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : COVID-19 is disrupting all aspects of our lives as we know it . Goldman Sachs is constantly evaluating the impact of the virus -- from volatility in markets to global trade , to the challenges and opportunities of working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insights from Goldman Sachs. ** <p> Not happy : There was quite a lot of criticism ( mostly behind the scenes ) in some national reactions to the Commission 's plans , EU diplomats relayed to Playbook . Leaders wanted to wait until this week is over to present the way forward , with Easter a natural landmark , even in secular societies . <p> Good old fashioned paternalism : Plus , national capitals appear to be suffering from a widespread mistrust in their citizens ' intellectual capacities . In order to avoid people running wild once the leash is loosened , one school of thinking forbids any talk , or even thought , about when and how to awaken from the current hibernation of individual , social and economic life before lockdowns show full results . <p> So do n't use the ' e ' word -- and welcome to exit strategy week . As not all countries have been equally struck by the pandemic , the next steps might look different -- and may differ in timing -- around the EU . But this week , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lifting containment measures . " More on that in a minute . But first ... <h> MALTA PUTS LIBYA IN THE SPOTLIGHT <p> NO MIGRANTS IN CORONA TIMES , PLEASE : The Maltese government is calling on the EU to make a fresh push for Libya to stop migrants trying to reach European soil . The EU should " boost the empowerment of the Libyan Coast Guard in enhancing the control of its borders , as well as concretely ensuring that Libya represents a safe port for the disembarkation of migrants , " Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo and Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri wrote in a letter to the EU 's High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell , dated Monday and obtained by Playbook . <p> Malta also requests the EU " launch an immediate humanitarian mission in Libya -- providing food , medicines and health care equipment , " with humanitarian aid that is " imminent and substantial -- today and not tomorrow . " Valletta warns that " over 650,000 people await to leave Libyan shores for Europe , " adding that " there are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as desperate people look at the Mediterranean Sea as their only escape . " <p> The scenario : " Libya today represents a complex landscape plagued with difficulties across conflict , health , humanitarian and migration dimensions , all of which are snowballing at this very moment , " the ministers write . " The COVID-19 crisis is also leaving its mark in Libya and is weakening an already fragile health system . Moreover , humanitarian assistance on the ground continues to decrease . " <p> In light of the above , the Maltese say they " hereby respectfully ask your services to ... come back with a paper of options to be discussed at an emergency Foreign Affairs Council convened at the earliest opportunity and before the upcoming European Council " -- scheduled for April 23 .

It 's not even that every German company was told to shut down production -- some did so because their supply chains across Europe were no longer operating . <p> Any doubt about the need for coordination ? BDI 's Director General Joachim Lang told his Italian peer , Confindustria 's Marcella Panucci , in the letter that as " the Italian and the German industries are closely interlinked , we mutually depend on the suppliers and partners from each other 's country . " Lang added that he expects " that national productions will not be able to return to normal levels straight away . In order to consider all dimensions of the value chains , production has therefore to be restarted on equal levels across the production process .

Not all regions are equal : In Lombardy , Italy 's worst-hit area , people need to be patient longer when it comes to shopping . In Veneto , on the other hand , the regional government went further and lifted the requirement that people must stay within 200 meters of their homes for physical exercise .

Safdar said she was not allowed to reveal the exact number of children who 've come to her hospital with the disease , but said , " It 's very few . " <p> " I think it was a bit of a surprise , " she said of the finding that children are less susceptible . " It is a new virus and nobody has immunity .

But because children have better immune protection than older adults , they are getting far less ill . <p> The reason , he believes , is that as people get older they rely more and more on the innate immune system , which is more of a first-responder to viruses and foreign invaders . <p> The innate system is not precisely targeted like the adaptive immune system , which makes antibodies that are specific to a virus or bacteria . Willoughby compared the adaptive immune system to a hospital , where patients receive more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As Willoughby explains it , the innate immune system is " designed to shoot first and ask questions later . " As a result , when the system senses the virus entering the lungs later in the course of COVID-19 , it launches an all-out attack that damages both diseased and healthy cells in the organ . <p> As we age , that targeted adaptive immune system weakens . <p> In other diseases , such as influenza , an older patient might have some immunity based on having encountered the disease before . <p> They have no such advantage with the new coronavirus . Their immune systems are weaker and have never seen the virus before . Although children have n't seen the virus either , their immune systems are stronger and better able to handle the onslaught . <p> At UW Health , Safdar said the reason children have been less severely affected by COVID-19 is not entirely certain .

" They 're good nose-wipers and they put their hands on everything . " <p> And it 's not just that adults will get the virus , but they are also likely to get far more of it when they are in close quarters with their children for long periods . When children are not feeling well , even if the symptoms are mild , mothers and fathers tend to hold them close . <p> " We 're social creatures , and children need to be comforted , " Willoughby said .

They are a result of things people do to nature . <p> Disease , it turns out , is largely an environmental issue .

Since then there have been 12 smaller outbreaks in South Asia . <p> In Australia , where four people and dozens of horses have died of Hendra , the scenario was different : suburbanization lured infected bats that were once forest-dwellers into backyards and pastures . If a henipah virus evolves to be transmitted readily through casual contact , the concern is that it could leave the jungle and spread throughout Asia or the world . " Nipah is spilling over , and we are observing these small clusters of cases -- and it 's a matter of time that the right strain will come along and efficiently spread among people , " says Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York-based organization that studies the ecological causes of disease . <p> That 's why experts say it 's critical to understand underlying causes . " Any emerging disease in the last 30 or 40 years has come about as a result of encroachment into wild lands and changes in demography , " says Peter Daszak , a disease ecologist and the president of EcoHealth . <p> Emerging infectious diseases are either new types of pathogens or old ones that have mutated to become novel , as the flu does every year . AIDS , for example , crossed into humans from chimpanzees in the 1920s when bush-meat hunters in Africa killed and butchered them . <p> Diseases have always come out of the woods and wildlife and found their way into human populations -- the plague and malaria are two examples . But emerging diseases have quadrupled in the last half-century , experts say , largely because of increasing human encroachment into habitat , especially in disease " hot spots " around the globe , mostly in tropical regions . And with modern air travel and a robust market in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large population centers is enormous . <p> The key to forecasting and preventing the next pandemic , experts say , is understanding what they call the " protective effects " of nature intact . In the Amazon , for example , one study showed an increase in deforestation by some 4 percent increased the incidence of malaria by nearly 50 percent , because mosquitoes , which transmit the disease , thrive in the right mix of sunlight and water in recently deforested areas . Developing the forest in the wrong way can be like opening Pandora 's box . These are the kinds of connections the new teams are unraveling . <p> Public health experts have begun to factor ecology into their models . Australia , for example , has just announced a multimillion-dollar effort to understand the ecology of the Hendra virus and bats . <p> IT 'S not just the invasion of intact tropical landscapes that can cause disease . The West Nile virus came to the United States from Africa but spread here because one of its favored hosts is the American robin , which thrives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which spread the disease , find robins especially appealing . " The virus has had an important impact on human health in the United States because it took advantage of species that do well around people , " says Marm Kilpatrick , a biologist at the University of California , Santa Cruz . The pivotal role of the robin in West Nile has earned it the title " super spreader . " <p> And Lyme disease , the East Coast scourge , is very much a product of human changes to the environment : the reduction and fragmentation of large contiguous forests . Development chased off predators -- wolves , foxes , owls and hawks . That has resulted in a fivefold increase in white-footed mice , which are great " reservoirs " for the Lyme bacteria , probably because they have poor immune systems . And they are terrible groomers . When possums or gray squirrels groom , they remove 90 percent of the larval ticks that spread the disease , while mice kill just half . " So mice are producing huge numbers of infected nymphs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When we do things in an ecosystem that erode biodiversity -- we chop forests into bits or replace habitat with agricultural fields -- we tend to get rid of species that serve a protective role , " Dr. Ostfeld told me . " There are a few species that are reservoirs and a lot of species that are not . The ones we encourage are the ones that play reservoir roles . " <p> Dr. Ostfeld has seen two emerging diseases -- babesiosis and anaplasmosis -- that affect humans in the ticks he studies , and he has raised the alarm about the possibility of their spread . <p> The best way to prevent the next outbreak in humans , specialists say , is with what they call the One Health Initiative -- a worldwide program , involving more than 600 scientists and other professionals , that advances the idea that human , animal and ecological health are inextricably linked and need to be studied and managed holistically . <p> " It 's not about keeping pristine forest pristine and free of people , " says Simon Anthony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Columbia University 's Mailman School of Public Health . " It 's learning how to do things sustainably . If you can get a handle on what it is that drives the emergence of a disease , then you can learn to modify environments sustainably . " <p> The scope of the problem is huge and complex . Just an estimated 1 percent of wildlife viruses are known . Another major factor is the immunology of wildlife , a science in its infancy . Raina K. Plowright , a biologist at Pennsylvania State University who studies the ecology of disease , found that outbreaks of the Hendra virus in flying foxes in rural areas were rare but were much higher in urban and suburban animals . She hypothesizes that urbanized bats are sedentary and miss the frequent exposure to the virus they used to get in the wild , which kept the infection at low levels . That means more bats -- whether from poor nutrition , loss of habitat or other factors -- become infected and shed more of the virus into backyards . <p> THE fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Predict . EcoHealth and its partners -- the University of California at Davis , the Wildlife Conservation Society , the Smithsonian Institution and Global Viral Forecasting -- are looking at wildlife-borne viruses across the tropics , building a virus library . Most of the work focuses on primates , rats and bats , which are most likely to carry diseases that affect people . <p> Most critically , Predict researchers are watching the interface where deadly viruses are known to exist and where people are breaking open the forest , as they are along the new highway from the Atlantic to the Pacific across the Andes in Brazil and Peru . " By mapping encroachment into the forest you can predict where the next disease could emerge , " Dr. Daszak , EcoHealth 's president , says . " So we 're going to the edge of villages , we 're going to places where mines have just opened up , areas where new roads are being built . We are going to talk to people who live within these zones and saying , ' what you are doing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to people about how they butcher and eat bush meat or to those who are building a feed lot in bat habitat . In Bangladesh , where Nipah broke out several times , the disease was traced to bats that were raiding containers that collected date palm sap , which people drank . The disease source was eliminated by placing bamboo screens ( which cost 8 cents each ) over the collectors . <p> EcoHealth also scans luggage and packages at airports , looking for imported wildlife likely to be carrying deadly viruses . And they have a program called PetWatch to warn consumers about exotic pets that are pulled out of the forest in disease hot spots and shipped to market . <p> All in all , the knowledge gained in the last couple of years about emerging diseases should allow us to sleep a little easier , says Dr. Epstein , the EcoHealth veterinarian . " For the first time , " he said , " there is a coordinated effort in 20 countries to develop an early warning system for emerging zoonotic outbreaks . "

@@31844541 <h> Douglas Rooks : A federal judge in search of the truth <p> With Donald Trump 's statement that he was " surprised " by Dr. Anthony Fauci 's comments before a Senate committee that the nation could run undue risks by reopening too soon , we 've closed the circle on how this president intends to deal with the coronavirus crisis . <p> No one could actually be surprised , since the many unknown variables for this pandemic form the reality of our days , and our nightmares as well . <p> That Trump pretends to be surprised only confirms what we already knew : that a president who has yet to come up with a plan for anything is not going to come up with one here , either . To the nation 's governors , the message is clear : You 're on your own , and do n't expect any further help . <p> It 's eerily similar to earlier Republican attitudes , fully adopted by Trump , about global warming . First , it 's a " hoax " concocted by his adversaries , then it 's a problem too big to do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only thing that really matters to him : maintaining power by winning re-election in November . Coronavirus may even be useful , in that it may distract attention from other outrageous behavior . <p> Take the Department of Justice 's attempt to dismiss two guilty pleas entered by Michael Flynn , Trump 's first National Security advisor , for lying to federal investigators -- the one criminal case brought by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller before turning things back over to the DOJ , which quickly shelved the Russia investigation . <p> Flynn pleaded guilty more than two years ago , but has never been sentenced because he 's tried to withdraw the pleas , in which effort he was encouraged and celebrated by the president , using his other favorite word : " witchhunt . " <p> Trump has spoken of pardoning Flynn , but perhaps decided that might be a bridge too far , and instead prevailed on Attorney General William Barr to request dismissal . Barr , who 's become Trump 's personal attorney in all but name , had to work pretty hard to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one from St. Louis to make the necessary recommendation . Withdrawing a plea without giving an even plausible reason is not something prosecutors do , but Barr was more than willing . <p> The administration plan encountered what the New York Times called an " astonishing " roadblock when Judge Emmet Sullivan refused to dismiss , and instead brought in a former prosecutor and federal judge , John Gleeson , to investigate the reasons for the dismissal request . <p> Gleeson , who 's put notorious mobsters behind bars , should be up to the task , and while he 's at work , it 's doubtful the president can return to the pardon idea . What was " astonishing " was not the judge 's decision , but the Attorney General 's move to dismiss in the first place . <p> Not since Watergate has an Attorney General so signally failed to uphold the law , and Barr 's performance may yet make John Mitchell -- who served 19 months in prison -- look like a mere co-conspirator . It 's worth recalling that Maine 's Sen. Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sen. Angus King voted no . <p> The Flynn maneuvering was part of a larger attempt to convince voters that , not only was Trump 's impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his November rival , Joe Biden , a " witchhunt , " but the earlier Russia investigation -- originated after Vladimir Putin 's well-documented interference in 2016 on Trump 's behalf -- was also baseless . <p> That this narrative has gotten this far is alarming , but it may have met its match in the person of one low-ranking federal judge . In this , too , it recalls Watergate -- the last time a president was held accountable for illegal and unconstitutional actions . <p> John Sirica was presiding over the trial of five defendants in what the Nixon administration termed a " third rate burglary attempt , " and was unsatisfied that their connections with Republican operatives had been revealed .

So there already was a shortage of bodies above and beyond the Wuhan Virus . <p> What saved academia in the 1980 's and 1990 's ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of non-traditional-aged women who had started their families in their early 20 's rather than going to college -- and instead went in their mid 40 's . That 's not going to happen now because ( unlike their mothers ) the Millennial women have already gone to college -- higher ed is over 60%/40% female majority . <p> And China has rebuilt the universities that it destroyed during the Cultural Revolution , India has built its own , and hence both countries are increasingly going to educate their children domestically . ( China was already in the midst of a major recession prior to the Wuhan Virus . ) <p> Some predict that upwards of *half* of the existing colleges and universities will close in the next 10 years -- and that likely will apply to law schools as well . It 's a simple case of bodies and money , bodies to put into the seats and those bodies having the money to pay ever-increasing tuition -- and a shortage of both . <p> I think the ROI on a top-tier law school is worth it if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an associate position with the large salary out of law school ( or a clerkship ) . Or if you just have the money to spend and would like the experience . <p> In my own experience , I was accepted into , and graduated from , a Top14 law school ( not sure why they cut off at 14 , maybe because of ties ? ) , and paid full freight ( well , borrowed $125k for the 3 years , and paid it back with interest after 12 years ) . But I had also been offered a full scholarship to Notre Dame 's law school . At 21 , I of course wanted to go to the better law school , and went into debt to do so . And while I have enjoyed the respect I receive among local lawyers when they ask what law school I attended , I 'm certainly not earning any more than my colleagues who attended a Tier 2 or 3 school . ( I either did n't apply myself enough in law school or was not as smart as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I coasted our with was not going to lead to a clerkship or BigLaw hire . ) So unless I 'm placing a high value on the intangibles of my degree , in retrospect I should have taken the full ride to Notre Dame , and ended up in the same type of job I have now . <p> If college students considering law school ever ask , I tell them to go to a lower ranked law school that offers a good scholarship , rather than a higher ranked school that does n't , unless they are pretty near certain they will graduate near the top of the class at law school ( based on having done so in college , not just self confidence ) , AND that they desire to go into BigLaw as a career . If they want to be a local prosecutor or PD , or work for a municipality or a small to medium size firm , I tell them that from my experience the better law school will not be a factor in their position 10 years down the line . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why some of the worst law schools around charge at least as high tuition ( if not higher ! ) than much better schools . Within 100 miles from my town , there are probably At least 5-7 really bad law schools ( who accept anyone ) and their tuition costs are insane . Many of their students do n't even graduate , and those that do have like a 20% Bar pass rate , and thus they are enticing people to go $150,000 in debt for an almost worthless product , where most of the students will never actually practice law , but will have a lifetime of non-dischargeable , six-figure debt to deal with . <p> We will see how the Coronavirus and the economic fallout affects the legal job market in the medium term , but until the virus hit , this was the best time in a long time , maybe ever , to attend law school . Applicant pool still well below the peak , and law schools offering generous scholarships . So you could still get into a " better " law school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . And if you are willing to go to a lower rank law school -- say you got into Duke , but you were willing to go to your home state school of Indiana-Bloomington ( still a fine school ) , you could likely go for free or close to it . <p> First , the " maybe ever " part was silly . Perhaps even so silly it was a botched attempt at sarcasm ? <p> My recollection of the ' 90s is that that period was very good for law graduates , too . I have n't been involved in hiring lawyers since 2004 but I suspect the market was better than that it is now , also . <p> this was the best time in a long time , maybe ever , to attend law school . <p> Many people are saying that there has never been a better time in all of history to attend law school . Just recently , a good friend of mine , who is an expert at law school , told me this is an unprecedented time for attending law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for centuries . Millions and millions of young beautiful kids are going to law school and making more money than any profession has ever made . <p> Job market was quite good pre-Corona . Not as good as the late 90s , for example , but you have to think of it this way : Let 's say 70% of the class at Georgetown gets jobs at firms paying 200K , and Boston College 35% . In 1998 , you would get a relatively " better " job in terms of pay , promotion , etc. from Georgetown . But in 2018 , you were more likely to get into Georgetown to begin with ; in 1998 you might have been at BC with the same credentials . ( These are just hypos , the ease of getting in has actually eased up more at lower-ranked schools ) . Or you could go to BC at a huge discount in 2018 and be more likely to be near the top of the class . So it 's job market plus competition from other students for admission and jobs plus how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job market has been better , but combined with the other factors , it 's been a great time to go to law school . I saw somewhere that average tuition at a *private* school , not sticker price , but what 's actually being charged , is something like 18K a year . That 's less than my last year of law school cost 30 years ago . <p> It 's not so much of interest that schools will open in the fall , of course they will , like all grade and high schools . But what percent will be foreign students , particularly the Chinese , paying full price , that colleges depend on to balance their budgets ? That 's the interesting question . <p> When I was in graduate school recently , the Chinese yanked the rug out from under my university about a reciprocity program . They were banking on tons of Chinese students paying full price to make up their budget gap . Of course , these students were going to take slots from taxpaying in-state citizens . <p> One professor said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Chinese want the STEM expertise the university provides but without the social sciences ( and associated luggage ) reciprocity that the university put into the deal . I ca n't say I blame them . <p> 1 . No , there is not a complete ABA-accredited monopoly . That said , the vast majority of states either require it , or the path without it is onerous ( IIRC , Virginia allows you to " apprentice , " Mass. has non-accredited schools , and California , famously , has the " Baby Bar " ) . Given the great disparity in the level of practice you will normally see , graduating from an ABA law school AND passing the bar is the bare minimum , and usually indicates that the person in question can breathe with their mouth closed . Sometimes . <p> 2. " until the virus hit , this was the best time in a long time , maybe ever , to attend law school " <p> I do n't even . Things have certainly trended up since law schools ( and the graduates , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Things have gotten better in the last , oh , six years or so " is hardly the same ringing endorsement . <p> If you get into a T15 , it 's a good investment . If you get a free ride at another school , it 's worth it . Otherwise , caveat emptor . <p> " I saw somewhere that average tuition at a *private* school , not sticker price , but what 's actually being charged , is something like 18K a year . That 's less than my last year of law school cost 30 years ago . " <p> Prof. Bernstein teaches at George Mason , which is a good public law school . That said .... the non-discounted cost to attend ( 2018 start ) is $190k ( non-resident , assume out of state ) . If you are one of the people that GMU is paying full freight , that 's a good deal ! I mean , you still have living expenses , but still . <p> If you go to GMU Law , you should be prepared to practice locally- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so assuredly most people are prepared for that . <p> If you graduate from GMU Law , you have an approximate 66% chance of securing a long-term job that requires a JD and bar passage . Congratulations ! <p> Now , I want to emphasize this again- this a good regional law school . It 's ranked , what , #42 right now ? Decent school . Good for them . <p> There are SO MANY WORSE SCHOOLS . So look at those numbers ... the good numbers , from a good school . <p> P.S. Our target enrollment , and basically our average enrollment , before the post-Great Recession bust was 220 . The year we took in 300 was an anomaly , it was either 2010 or 11 , and every other law school had a big drop in matriculation , but we were oversubscribed , only to get slammed like everyone else the following year . It 's now been ranging between 150 and 180 , we have cut our class size just like many other law school -- but not by half . <p> A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools these days , are getting discounts . Of course , the worse your job prospects are from a school , the less payoff you get from law school , though your opportunity cost may be lower . I do n't count living costs as a cost of law school unless going to law school involves moving out of your parents house , where your bills are all paid . After all , you have to pay for housing , rent , food , etc. whether you are in law school or not . The real additional cost of law schools is your opportunity cost of whatever job you would be holding those three years ( or whatever else you would be doing ) .

@@31841441 <p> For starters , one of you was kind enough to point out that my plan to read about 40 pages a week over eight weeks amounted to roughly 320 pages -- y'know , HALF of " Moby-Dick . " Suffice to say , there are reasons I 'm a writer and not a numbers person . Sorry . So if this works and you all enjoy it , it 'll run more like 16 weeks . I also realized quickly doing readings by pages made little sense since editions are paginated differently . So this week , we are looking at Chapters 1-7 . Next week , we 'll discuss Chapters 8-16 . <p> Also , the first video chat did n't quite go as planned . I grossly underestimated how much Zoom time to book for the discussion with Flynn . <p> We touched on the Etymology and Extracts and a few opening chapters but not all seven that we 'd planned to discuss . <p> We may try to fold some of them into the next chat without creating such a long video as to burden those of you who are following . <p> Also because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address our first reader query . Reader Kathryn expressed her affinity for books with extreme adventure , from " The Hobbit " to " The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . " She made an intriguing comparison between characters in " The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn " and " Moby-Dick " -- how both Huck and Ishmael " are aware of the social attitudes about characters like Queequeg and Jim , but they are both open-minded and non-judgemental in the end . " <p> She wondered if Twain and Melville had any interaction or expressions of admiration for one another 's work . And she had another query about Melville 's subtle use of humor , and thought the " use of names to evoke the characters " reminded her of Dickens ' work . <p> So first , thanks to Kathryn for our first query , which I 'll address as two separate entries that -- I hope -- end up twisting together . <p> I checked " Autobiography of Mark Twain : The " but found no reference to Melville . That said , the book also bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book does n't necessarily mean anything . But it does bring up the well-documented connection between Hawthorne and Melville . Hawthorne was 15 years Melville 's elder . Roughly 10 years separates their first significant published works . But Melville met Hawthorne in 1850 and exhibited a extravagant devotion for the writer he said , " Dropped germinous seeds into my soul . " " Moby-Dick " was published a little more than a year later , so those were quite some seeds . Notable , also : The book is dedicated to Hawthorne . <p> Hawthorne saw something critics and readers did n't . He wrote admiringly of " Moby-Dick , " but the book was n't as well regarded as it has become in the years since . It sold poorly during Melville 's lifetime . <p> Twain would 've been a teenager when the book was published . His " The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County " short story was published in 1865 , 14 years after " Moby-Dick . " But Twain 's renown blossomed as Melville 's turned cold . <p> That said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . There exists a belief among some readers that Melville 's work was humorless , but on the contrary , I find humor flecked -- not laced , but flecked -- throughout the book . We encounter it in our first seven chapters , particularly as Ishmael argues with himself about how to spend a night , whether to bunk up with a harpooner he 's not seen . Ishmael does n't revel in the comedy of his sleeping situation , but these pages do play out with a certain comedic rhythm as he endures and later reflects upon Queequeg " on the whole " as " a clean , comely-looking cannibal . " <p> The accompanying video includes a little discussion about Melville 's sense of humor . We also touch on the seemingly endless metaphors for death throughout the book starting early and continuing through to its end . We have an innkeeper named Coffin . We have a visit to an African-American church , where Melville/Ishmael lay it on thick with " a black Angel of Doom " in the pulpit whose text is " about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , our era : The book was published in 1851 . I do n't recall a specific time indicator within these first seven chapters other than the marble tablets in Chapter 7 . The most recent of them dedicated to the six men killed on The Ship Eliza who were " towed out of sight by a Whale " on Dec. 31 , 1839 , which I believe is about a year before Melville 's first major trip to sea . <p> We should n't get ahead of ourselves , though ... <p> In the video we touch on the first page of " Moby-Dick . " Flynn reads from a compressed re-done version of the book designed likely for a young reader . It implies our narrator takes to the sea out of a sense of adventure . I 'd love to hear your thoughts on this , as the first paragraph sounds instead to me like a description of depression , and a rudderless Ishmael throwing himself into this story not out of restlessness , but because of some darker impulse : <p> " Whenever I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a damp , drizzly November in my soul ; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses , and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet ; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me , that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street , and methodically knocking people 's hats off -- then , I account it high time to get to the sea as soon as I can . " <p> Doubling back to Kathryn 's email : I read an account that suggested Melville began dark and arced toward a brighter tone , whereas Twain 's career started with a lighter tone and then arced toward darker writing . <p> I just do n't see that arc in Melville 's work . He enjoyed some success , wrote his opus , which hit the shore like a dead whale -- large and unwanted . I believe the figure sits at about 3,000 copies sold during his lifetime . His work that followed was regarded with even less enthusiasm . He dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's star was rising , Melville was dealing with a stalled career , a dead son and big questions of faith . <p> So I feel nearly certain the two did n't cross paths physically or even via correspondence . I feel like correspondence would 've been made public . Which leaves the vaporous notion of influence . And here , I 'll direct you to the video . Flynn discusses the format of the book and how it influenced his memoir , " Another ( Expletive ) Night in Suck City . " Flynn 's commentary in our conversation shows just how broad a writer 's influence can be on another . I 'll try not to paraphrase him here : There 's no point since you can hear him talk about it in the video . But when he was struggling to find a format for his story , he found inspiration in Melville 's novel : Its short chapters ; its diverse tonal forms within the short chapters , some of which in " Moby-Dick " are driven by events , some are driven by history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Twain were n't separated by that many years -- in fact , roughly the same number that separated Melville from Hawthorne -- and were writers familiar with traversing bodies of water . I 'd say Twain 's work drew from folklore and Melville 's more from mythology . Both knew their way around a good allegory . And I do think both had a working sense of humor , but Melville 's feels rarer to me . <p> And I think that question is a good point of entry into our first week of reading . Because some of the humor is here , particularly as our narrator bumbles his way toward this adventure , finding a most unlikely roommate . <p> It starts almost with an incantation ( more on this in the video ) . Or a request for an audience . " God will hear " . . . that 's the origin of " Ishmael . " <p> The first sentence -- " Call me Ishmael. " -- is among the most famous ever penned . We discuss it some in the video . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> I feel like I may have short-changed some of the later chapters from this first block of text .

All the fatalities have happened since April 1 . <p> In the meantime , officials at the two NHS trusts with hospitals in north and south Cumbria have confirmed the deaths of 244 Covid-19 patients - 109 of them split between The Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle and West Cumberland Hospital in Whitehaven . <p> Cumbria 's director of public health Colin Cox said that the rate of hospital deaths in the county appeared to be decelerating - hopefully evidence that social distancing is slowing infection rates . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Cox . <p> This deceleration is happening faster than some other UK areas .

@@61804041 <h> During a pandemic , access to accurate and current information is key . <p> Data sharing is more important than ever under the current coronavirus pandemic , says Andrew Brown , Deputy Managing Executive for Altron HealthTech . Interestingly enough , one of the key tenets of the government 's mooted National Health Insurance is that public and private healthcare be able to share patient data as the person moves through the system . It goes without saying that this data should be secured and only shared with the patient 's permission , adds Brown . <p> However , the NHI is only due to come into force in 2026 , while the current COVID-19 pandemic is highlighting more than ever that the healthcare sector needs to relook at how it manages patient data , sooner rather than later . There also needs to be increasing focus on the quality of data in that patient data must be captured correctly from the outset in order to create a unique patient identifier . <p> All healthcare practitioners , regardless of whether they 're public or private sector , face an enormous challenge around capturing patient information accurately . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to capture their information , suggests Brown . Regardless of how they manage it , going forward , as envisioned by the NHI , private and public sector healthcare providers will need to be able to share salient patient data , which will have to be managed in a secure and compliant fashion , he says . <p> Does that mean COVID-19 is bringing the NHI deadline forward ? Well , it could certainly help prepare the healthcare system for its implementation , according to Brown . However , it 's unclear where the money is going to come from to pay for the implementation of solutions required to enable the type of data sharing that 's envisioned . The COVID-19 lockdown is costing the South African economy an estimated R13 billion a day . The economic implications are huge , impacting businesses of all sizes , creating unprecedented unemployment and the resulting decline in tax collection . " The government is going to need to spend money to get the NHI up and running , but where will it come from ? We need the NHI sooner rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dream unaffordable . " <p> The digitisation of patient data and the ability to share that data holds benefits for healthcare providers , those who pay for the healthcare ( either medical aids or government ) and patients alike . The aim is to digitise interaction across these three parties , improving communication to provide more cost-effective and better quality healthcare to the patient , states Brown . <p> The pandemic means the patient 's world had changed significantly . Instead of arriving at their GP 's rooms and sitting in the waiting room to see a doctor who is invariably running late , they want to book their appointment online , fill in their demographic details at the same time and be told how late the physician is running so they can wait at home or in their car . Nobody wants to sit in a waiting room full of sick people . <p> Telemedicine guidelines are changing to allow doctors to consult with existing patients remotely . A repeat prescription can be issued digitally and the medicines couriered to the patient 's house . However , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare professionals capture information electronically so it can be shared . Health complications as a result of COVID-19 might require referrals between practitioners -- such as pathology or radiology -- and ongoing care to get people back to full health . This team of caregivers will require visibility into a single clinical record for that patient . Results can be shared with the patient via virtual session . All of this reduces the risk of cross-contamination , which is as relevant for the patient as it is for the healthcare provider , who does n't wish to risk either their own or their employees ' health . <p> For this reason , healthcare providers are big proponents of telemedicine solutions . Being on the frontline , they are most likely to get infected . While telemedicine is convenient for patients in that they can get on with their day while waiting for their appointment to happen , it has now become a safety consideration for healthcare professionals , driven by the pandemic , says Brown . <p> There 's a growing need for on-demand healthcare , digitisation and accessibility -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to drive innovation so patients can have access to physicians using their smartphones . Putting more data about their health into the hands of patients is a major driver of innovation in this space . <p> For the payers , access to good quality data means they can better manage their member population . By providing them with detailed information about every COVID-19 patient being seen by a general practitioner , they could develop care and treatment plans to pre-empt people having to be admitted to hospital . Having access to information would enable them to do a better job of protecting their fund and the rest of their insured patients . <p> The ability to better manage costs while getting treatment plans out as quickly as possible equally applies to the public sector . The hospitals just ca n't cope with the numbers of patients that are turning up , so if they have advanced warning in the form of up-to-date , accurate information , they can plan around anticipated patient numbers , while also helping people to isolate themselves and self-medicate before they require hospitalisation .

Alternatively , Brown proposes that a ticketing system could be implemented , where people are allocated a number in the queue and told roughly what time to return . <p> The one key aspect of the current pandemic , and one that keeps being raised , is access to up-to-date data .

The NHI will ultimately require this in order for healthcare providers to be paid for their services . <p> " This is where the big data really comes into its own , " he adds , " identifying where to deploy providers , where to do more screening , which areas are running out of tests and getting the right medication to the right areas on time .

Gizmodo has verified the authors ' identities , and submissions have been edited for length , grammar , and clarity . <p> Anonymous , district attorney prosecutor , mid-Atlantic region <p> I am a prosecutor in a sizable district attorney 's office . My colleagues and I have spent the last three weeks watching our criminal justice system slowly crash and burn . Once covid-19 started spreading , our DA started reaching out to other judicial , criminal , and government bodies asking how we would address the virus if it spread stateside . Most of them thought he was panicky and brushed off his concerns . <p> Every day the DA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were doing and how to proceed forward . They told us they were in constant communication with our judges , commissioners , etc . They had proposed a series of plans to continue criminal proceedings that would assist in flattening the curve . They were repeatedly told that the plans were being taken under advisement . In all reality , everyone ( except our office ) was treating covid-19 as something that would n't happen . <p> Then the president addressed the country and indicated covid-19 was a real thing . The mayor where our courthouse was located declared a state of emergency . Jurors stopped showing up for trials . Witnesses were freaked out . Our office started rescheduling trials as quickly as we could because we were concerned we would n't have sufficient jurors to proceed forward . Some defence attorneys ( mainly private counsel from out-of-county ) simply told us they were n't coming due to health concerns . <p> Then Monday hit . <p> Suddenly jurors for all trials , civil and criminal , were cancelled . The county prison was put on lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time getting in to see their clients , and the warden indicated that anyone who was on work release would be furloughed until further notice . The probation department said they would no longer be doing home visits . We watched as various county agencies shuttered their doors one by one . <p> As prosecutors , we are essential government employees . We still rely on a physical file system , so while some of our duties can be accomplished from home , our support staff needs to come into the office . Furthermore , there needs to be a representative of our office for any ongoing criminal proceedings . Our DA said that we could stay home if we desired ( we have a lot of immunocompromised folks and folks with kids who are out of school for the foreseeable future ) , but otherwise we need to be there and keep our communities safe . Based on CDC recommendations , all employees were split between two shifts to lessen our numbers . That means the early shift starts at 7 a.m. and the late shift ends at 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we 've run into bigger issues . <p> Our office has tried to give priority to any proceeding involving an incarcerated defendant ( their liberty and speedy trial rights are most at issue ) . Originally the judges seemed on board with that . We created a plan to have all incarcerated defendants participate via video call for essential proceedings ( e.g. , preliminary hearings , bail hearings , restraining order violations , motions to suppress , bench trials , etc . ) . There were strict guidelines that only 12 people could be in a courtroom at a time . The problem is that judges treat their courtrooms like their personal fiefdoms and do whatever the hell they want . Some judges continued to transport prisoners and people in the courtrooms were packed in like sardines . With other judges we would go over every scheduled proceeding with chambers , indicate the important ones ( say , I do n't know , sentencings in homicides ) only to learn they were rescheduled the next day . Some judges actually stuck with the plan . <p> Then our state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial buildings to the public . They suspended the statutory equivalent of speedy trial until April 3 . They gave a VERY abbreviated list of essential hearings , which included bail/temporary restraining orders/warrants/Gagnon I hearings and not much else . Today we learned that all proceedings for the next two weeks , regardless of what it was or if the defendant was incarcerated , were rescheduled until after April 14 . The judges are now going to be on a rotating schedule ( which we do n't have ) . There 's been no clear line of communication -- we have to piece everything together from different agencies . <p> These criminal hearings wo n't disappear . They will be rescheduled months down the line . I 've received scheduling orders for late June . So not only are defendant 's having proceedings delayed for an indefinite period of time , but we are setting ourselves up for a massive glut whenever restrictions are lifted . <p> In the meantime , we need to explain to our witnesses and victims what is happening and why we ca n't push forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 months before a resolution , and all that time victims can not move on or heal . It 's horribly traumatic , and now we need to keep them on board for even longer . <p> Our office is doing everything we can to ensure that incarcerated defendants are given priority . We are still preparing for trial . As of right now , we only have one courtroom open per day with limited proceedings for incarcerated defendants ( all of which are appearing via video from the prisons ) . We are also very careful with who we request to be held during bail hearings . We are cognisant that every body we add to the prison system could pose a health threat to other prisoners and staff , but we have to balance that with the danger they may pose to society . <p> I have the privilege of being young , healthy , and having a salaried job ; I 'm not afraid of covid-19 . I am deathly afraid of the collateral consequences of social distancing and how many people will die as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how to flatten *that* curve with the resources we have left . <p> The biggest issue is that we do n't know when we will be able to resume at the same case volume we once operated . Originally we thought it would be May , but as the infection rate climbs and we listen to what health experts project , it may not be until mid-summer . In spite of all of that , we are still doing everything we can while the courts are shut . As dramatic as it sounds , our office is part of a thin line holding back a constitutional crisis . <p> Anonymous , contractor vehicle operator with Waymo <p> The first policy change was sterilizing the vehicles each day and including disinfecting wipes in the vehicles .

I thought that our operation would be one of the few that could continue to function in the midst of the current situation . <p> Generating revenue for the project was not a top priority for Waymo as was stated during training which is why stopping our mission feels so out of place . On average I would have under five riders per week . Before we stopped driving the vehicles around I could do two to three days in between ride requests . So there was n't much change in our daily routine at work . This would be the ideal time to do more testing rather that halting it .

Something to feel like I am not just sitting at home waiting for a status update . I really do like what I am responsible for during my shift . <p> Without updates from Waymo as to when we can resume work I am feeling stressed about what will happen after the next two weeks . No guarantee of being paid and having to apply for unemployment is constantly in the back of mind .

We have an ageing workforce , many with decades of experience and expertise in operating this plant . Additionally , like the average American , we do have other health issues that put us in higher risk categories ( smoking , obesity , hypertension , etc ) . I 'm concerned that , along with other businesses , our company does n't know what *exactly* to do . <p> We have procedures and robust , in-depth back up systems for every situation short of gravity suddenly ceasing to exist .

With a majority of former military members in this field , I am not alone in this sentiment .

Jim Hawkins of the Alabama National Guard came back from the private sector to coordinate the unified command structure and make sure those agencies work together effectively . About half of the people working there are in the Guard , but Hawkins said the state health department is running the show . <p> " Public health personnel are embedded across all areas , " Hawkins said . " Anything we do should look like a normal public health solution . " <p> Inside the unified command , it might look like a typical , if sparsely decorated , office suite with an unusual dress code .

" the signs asks , over a cartoon Wile E. Coyote and clipart of three parachuters gliding down to safety . " You are making a difference ! ! Stay the course ! ! ! " <p> Another sign says " Keep calm what we do is hard , " in the style of the British campaign to carry on during World War II . <p> Inside the conference rooms , the walls are plastered with maps of the state of Alabama , organizational charts with contact information for the leaders of various divisions and status updates written on butcher paper . <p> In the data division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care facilities about how many beds , ventilators and intensive care unit spaces are available , providing as close to real-time information as possible to the Department of Public Health and the state . <p> " There 's a lot of different data streams , so one of the challenges is , how do you take all that disparate data and put it together in a package that enables sound discussions on policy and policy decisions ? " Hawkins said . " We 're not making policy in the unified command . We 're arming the administration with the facts . " <p> The logistics division takes requests from medical facilities and first responders around the state for more protective equipment like masks and gloves and uses National Guard or Alabama Forestry Commission to distribute material from the state 's stockpile to places where it 's most needed . <p> Procurement officer Bethany Elliott , who works for the Forestry Commission , said tracking down that PPE is getting somewhat easier , but is still a challenge . <p> " Our normal supply chains were almost non-existent , they just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we needed to go outside of the normal supply chains , " Elliott said .

" Those are lightweight gowns that you typically see in a lab setting that we could use a lot of those . If you 've got an empty factory somewhere and you want to start making gowns that 'd be perfect . " <p> Not everything is in short supply , however .

Lisa Pierce , who leads that division . " If you try to hire a company , it might cost about $10,000 to do that , so that 's a free service provided by the Guard . " <p> The unified command structure was implemented in late March , as the response to the disease was already well underway . Hawkins said the arrangement was like " building an airplane in the air .

@@61743741 <p> South Africa 's wealthiest , smartest business players have wasted no time in putting their teams to work on ways to contribute to fighting the Covid-19 pandemic and limiting its damage to the economy . Discovery 's Adrian Gore and colleagues , and their partners at Vodacom are the latest to step forward , in this case with a simple , powerful plan to create easy access to doctors for any South African who fears he or she might have contracted the deadly coronavirus . The move follows announcements by the families of billionaires Patrice Motsepe , Johann Rupert and Nicky Oppenheimer to contribute R1bn to efforts to assist businesses . Companies like Naspers have also committed funds to various prongs of the Covid-19 national strategy , offering R500m to the Solidarity Fund and about R1bn to pay for protective equipment for medical personnel and medical supplies . In this podcast with BizNews editor-in-chief Alec Hogg , Gore sets out the details of how the plan to create fast , cost-effective access to doctors will work . -- Jackie Cameron <p> We worked with them on a few issues and wanted to work with them again . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for free . We needed a telco partner where we could get the data for free . Vodacom and us have worked together on this very powerful idea and partnership , to get access to a doctor for Covid-19 entirely for free . They bring all the technology and we bring the doctor framework and the chassis we built . It 's taken us time to build a chassis but it 's a very simple powerful idea , to bring online access for all South Africans to a doctor for Covid-19 . <p> It 's got enormous potential , even for after Covid-19 which we can explore in a moment . Where did the whole idea come from , for the two of you get together ? <p> We 've had this platform we 've built over a number of years called DrConnect . If you look overseas , best practice is about tele-medicine , right in the front line just as the first point of contact , it makes healthcare accessible . The issue here in South Africa . The guideline has been that a doctor ca n't consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen him physically first , this has been a restriction . On the back of that we have n't actually rolled out DrConnect very aggressively , we 've almost kept it on ice . With the Covid-19 issue it is imperative you get care to all South Africans , we have this idea , could we do this at scale ? It 's taken years to build the DrConnect platform and chassis , but over weeks because of Vodacom , we have managed to scale it . <p> Has that blockage then been removed , that you do n't have to first go and consult with a doctor physically ? <p> No , it has n't , the HPCSA guidelines remain . That 's why this service is limited only to Covid-19 . It is about treating Covid-19 . We continue to be in consultation and discussion with HPCSA , the Health Professions Council . <p> But you 've pushed ahead anyway . <p> We feel the imperative is just too great , we 're rolling it out in the process . <p> Is any mobile phone able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have access to smartphones . The power is you can go on our site by web or on mobile and use it via video or text you , or you can phone Vodacom *111# line . It 's very accessible . <p> How many doctors are on the other end of the line ? <p> There are two sides to this is , patients across the country have access to it for free . The others , doctors consulting with existing patients , are concerned about patient contact if the patient is positive . We see the other applications as doctors using the existing base . This is rolling out now and we have a pretty substantial training regime . Doctors can sign up and be trained quickly and get online . We have a core of about 150 to 200 doctors initially and I heard this morning that 5000 doctor 's potential are going to join . We 're moving quite quickly and we 'll see in the next couple of days how we do . <p> How would the doctors get paid for their time ? <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultations . We have committed R20m between ourselves and Vodacom to essentially buying 100,000 consultations . If we go through that we will have to think about how to continue the funding and have a look at other sources of funding , but doctors are paid to consult that 's the intention . <p> What do they get paid per consult on this platform ? <p> It 's about R200 or so . It 's a standard fee and hopefully worthwhile for a doctor . <p> Is it for any South African , anywhere in the country with access to a smartphone , if they 're having some of the symptoms they can then pick up the phone call Vodacom even if they are n't a Vodacom client ? <p> If you 're not a Vodacom client , the data then will not be zero-rated so there is a cost to it . Our research has shown that many people use multiple SIM cards , so people have the ability to get on to the Vodacom network , that is the hope . They simply go on , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ID in and then do a verification through the Home Affairs system . The system then asks a set of questions about symptoms of Covid-19 and you can access a doctor via video . <p> You 've got a big operation in the UK where the National Health Service has got something similar , have you modeled DrConnect and this new Covid-19 a risk tool on anything that they 're producing ? <p> Absolutely . In the UK , there Is n't a restriction on doctors in the frontline , we have a virtual consultation service through vitality health in the UK they do close to 5,000 consults a week . We have used a lot of lessons we 've learned from it . It 's successful in markets like the UK , and we 'll really see how this plays out in this market . As I have said , it 's narrow to Covid-19 but I 'm sure through the process we 'll learn a lot about what 's possible with it . <p> Adrian , you 're an actuary do numbers mean a lot to you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a long way from South Africa 's current infection level of around 2,000 . Where do you see this going ? <p> It 's hard to tell . It 's the early phases of the pandemic. 1,200 to 1,300 cases reported , it 's growing at 30% today . The government and the president have acted remarkably swiftly and rigorously with the lockdown and hopefully we can flatten the curve quicker than other countries . But we 've got a large population of people who live in close quarters , people who immunes are compromised with HIV and TB . We 've got some unique challenges here . We have modelled a number of scenarios on the stuff coming out of the different countries , especially Imperial College predictions , and tried to understand where those numbers get to . The difficulty is the range of projections is incredibly wide , from kind of low to medium to high with where deaths can be hundreds of thousands . I do n't believe that will happen , I certainly hope it does n't , but we are preparing both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what we can and we can do what we need to for society and all of these projections . We 've modelled every single bit of data , we 've looked at our client base to understand people that are vulnerable and have learned that particular ages and comorbidities are more vulnerable than others . We 're reaching out to those vulnerable sectors of our client base to warn them to try and get them isolated and give advice to them . We are working 24 hours a day to use the data to try to keep people out of harm 's way , but the projections are very wide . <p> I had the opportunity to talk with your colleague and partner Alain Peddle who 's the deputy CEO of Ping An , it was fascinating to get his insights from what happened in China . It appears as though we 're drawing on those experiences . <p> We are , the Chinese lockdown was pretty substantial , the ability to flatten the curve is very much a function of how successful these processes are . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quite low , then in Spain and Italy the mortality is incredibly high . The riddle is trying to understand the denominator , how many people are really infected and trying to understand the age factors . You can draw a lot of lessons from each of these countries but I think we 're learning more about the best practice of flattening the curve , massive testing regimes , track and trace , which you 're not doing enough of , and hopefully start doing . We are trying our best to learn from all errors , the Chinese did a good job once they got going . The Germans have done a very good job , and I think Singapore and South Korea did a great job of containing things . We 've got the opportunity if we act swiftly . <p> All the countries that you mentioned , China , Singapore and South Korea have used digital tools aggressively . We heard from the president , Cyril Ramaphosa that those tools are now starting to be used . Is this a game changer potentially ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of people . You 've got to track and trace those people that are positive , that is a key in this battle . We have acted swiftly on the issue of lockdown , but we have n't done enough tests because of capacity issues . People are working around the clock , labs , business and the ICD and all the rest . It will be a game changer , we have got to move quicker on the testing and tracking your tracing , it is crucial . <p> Through this tool that people can access online before they even go to a consultation with a doctor , is this disease or is this virus specific enough for them to quickly understand whether they 've got it or not or if they 're at risk or not ? <p> The tool that we roll out primarily now is about telling us your symptoms and getting you to a doctor virtually . The doctor then decides one or three things , leave it if your fine or referring you to a pathology structure for a test , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the front line to a triage process that will happen after that . It 's trying to make the process into the health care system more informed , it 's not trying to replace it , it 's trying to make sure that right at the front line you get educated doctors helping people navigate the system . <p> One of our colleagues in the UK , Linda van Tilburg was saying that there , if you have symptoms , the National Health Service ( NHS ) will tell you to self-isolate for a week and thereafter to engage with them again to see how serious it is , whether you need a hospital bed or not . Is that a similar line that will be followed here ? <p> I 'm not sure . Every country has to optimise the resources that it has . The ability to test every single individual instantaneous and get results is the best thing , but it 's not practical . Every country has different ways somehow , I 'm not sure we would do that . I think if we look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing much more vigorously and in much greater numbers . The tests are expensive , they take a long time , 24 hours to do a PCR test , at the moment . I 'm hoping we can test more people far quicker . Track and trace , if we can do that , we 'll get on top of this thing . <p> You have experience with DrConnect already . Are we a nation of hypochondriacs or do we go on there when we 're really sick ? <p> I 've been asked that often , about the extent of health claims that are going to see through the process , so we have to model these things very carefully . What 's interesting is the other claim areas are dropping , like the elective surgery . The worried are a lot less eager to get into the healthcare system now . This thing quite quickly gets rid of any fluff , people focus more on serious things , they delay elective procedures . Some of our modelling shows ironically , that health care consumption , certainly in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the higher scenario of claims because the other stuff drops off . <p> I know it 's very early to start looking ahead , but the problem in South Africa and why national health has become such a big issue is because not all South Africans have access to proper healthcare . Surely something like this if it 's proven , would be able to open up a new avenue ? <p> It 's a good question , I do n't know the answer to it , but there 's an interesting vortex of solutions being built . I do n't think the world will be the same after this pandemic . Not only the way we work , but certainly in healthcare . Lessons will be learned , bridges will be built . I 'm hoping that this is a device that is quite the opposite of the current structures , a sustainable system that gives all South Africans access to healthcare in some way . That will be a very good outcome . <p> How else do you think the world 's going to change ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a week . We have 80% of people working at home now .

This idea of working from home which used to be an intellectual concept , which did n't really get going as it should have , is going to accelerate . We 're going to see a lot of profound differences in the way people think about how they work . The barrier between work and home has disappeared . On one hand it 's efficient , and on the other , it 's quite disarming . You do need routine and structure . There will be profound changes .

Is that a prospect for South Africa ? <p> I do n't know . It has both positive and negative consequences , if you 're not green you 're labeled as a potential danger . These things have different implications in different societies . The era of surveillance is going to be much more intense post pandemic for sure . <p> All South Africans now as a result of this can dial star triple one hash on a Vodacom phone or when they 're going through to Vodacom , and if they 've got Covid- 19 they will have access to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And there are enough medical professionals , with 5,000 who are prepared to come and join the system to be able to look after everyone in South Africa ? <p> That 's the hope .

I 'm very confident together with Vodacom we can achieve it . <p> And your models , how long will the R20m last ? <p> We modeled a number of scenarios but we do n't know .

@@71820041 <h> The politics of a pandemic : When Scott Morrison lost the plot <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has become a political crisis for Scott Morrison . He will survive for now , but as Dr Martin Hirst explains , he will likely become a victim of the coronavirus soon enough . <p> WHATEVER NATIONAL CONSENSUS holds at the moment between the Prime Minister and the premiers is fragile . We nearly saw it break right open on Sunday , when Daniel Andrews announced that Victoria was going to close down all non-essential " activity " and shutter state schools for an early and extended Easter break , whether Morrison agreed or not . <p> Andrews ' language was clear : <p> " I will inform National Cabinet tonight ... " <p> No asking , no discussion , not taking " No " for an answer . I do n't know what actually transpired in that phone hookup on Sunday evening , but Morrison was n't happy when he fronted the press pack . <p> That night , Morrison was angry , belligerent , unapologetic and rude . He also refused to take any responsibility for the shambolic confusing mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two to three weeks . <p> Morrison berated young people , sniped at their parents and essentially said it was our ( the public 's ) fault that the lockdown measures had to come into force this week . <p> It was interesting to note former Liberal adviser and now renegade shareholder activist Stephen Mayne attempt to defend Morrison 's poor performance on Twitter : <p> Ca n't remember Twitter going off quite as much as tonight - PM getting savaged . Did n't think it was as bad as the consensus appears to be . Important to put yourself in PM 's shoes and ask what you 'd do given ongoing social gatherings . <p> agreed to shut schools with some grace , instead of a hollow lecture on the importance of education ; <p> refrained from blaming young people ; and <p> had a plan in place before talking meaninglessly about " stage one " and " stage two " of the bungled response . <p> Failing all the above , he could resign . And this gets us neatly to the heart of the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrison 's own hubris . <p> He could have been remembered as the Prime Minister who brought the country together at a time of grave national threat . Morrison could have and he should have , but he did n't because he is incapable of real leadership . The PM 's credibility was shot to pieces when he snuck off to Hawaii in the midst of the bushfire crisis and then had his office staff deny -- on the record -- that he was there . <p> Any sensible leader would have learned from that PR disaster , but ScoMo is not that sensible leader . <p> He is out of his depth in the shallow end of Australian politics and that 's why he had to lean on the premiers and chief ministers for support . Even then , Morrison managed to bungle what should have been a political triumph . He invited the Labor premiers to the Cabinet table , but not the Federal Labor Leader . <p> At this powerful moment in time , Morrison could have risen above the hurly-burly of politics and cemented his place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He failed the country and he failed himself -- miserably . <p> He could easily have reached across the aisle and invited Albanese to join a dignified united front to tackle the coronavirus and the socio-economic fallout . His inability to do so was a fundamental mistake of leadership . But Morrison is nothing if not a fundamentalist . <p> The fundamentalist Morrison is , at heart , a culture warrior . He is a man of ideology , not a man of ideas . His fundamentalism and his combative nature do not afford him the mental space to think of coalition-building in the best interests of a confused nation , struggling to come to terms with what is , potentially , the biggest disaster in living memory , at least since World War II . <p> On Sunday night , Morrison gambled the last pennies of his once substantial political capital and he lost . Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months , ScoMo is a spent force now . He is politically wounded . He has lost control of the narrative and his political assassination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PM who led Australia into this crisis , but he 's unlikely to be the PM who leads us out the other side . <p> It will be instructive for the next prime minister to unpack where it all went wrong for #ScottyFromMarketing . The problem and the answer are all wrapped up in that singular and devastatingly humiliating three-word title . <p> " -- it would be safe to say when it comes to leadership , the PM should 've stuck to marketing , where notions such as those of a better lifestyle/happier times form basis for advertising campaigns/sales strategies but are not necessarily based on reality . " https : //t.co/q22gdYOd2e <h> Where it all went wrong for Smirko <p> Scott Morrison is the accidental Prime Minister . He was not supposed to win the August 2018 challenge . Peter Dutton was the anointed successor , but thanks to Mathias Cormann 's inept counting skills and Morrison 's treacherous ambition , here we are . <p> Let 's never doubt that Morrison wanted Turnbull 's job . He is as ambitious , it turns out , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clings , Gollum-like , to the precious illusion of an economic surplus -- the one that he famously said he 'd already delivered " next year " . Morrison 's policy-thinking is unoriginal and dogmatic . He is a captive to the toxic nostrums of the Institute of Public Affairs -- intellectually dominated by the disciples of Hayek , Rand and Friedman . To Morrison and his fundamentalist colleagues , John Maynard Keynes is just another name for " Lucifer " . <p> At his thinking core , Morrison is a Thatcherite wrecker . There is no such thing as " unfunded empathy " and we 've been starkly reminded of that through the first month of this pandemic . <p> At every turn , Morrison and his gormless sidekick , Josh Frydenberg , have laid in plans to prop up big business and the shareholders who want their franking credits and their surplus too . <h> Policy vacuum in the Canberra bubble <p> There is a policy vacuum inside Scott Morrison 's Canberra bubble and as Aristotle reminds us , nature abhors a vacuum . The political seals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the pressure of circumstance . Morrison will barricade himself inside the bubble for the foreseeable future and the electoral cycle is on his side . <p> It 's been less than a year since the last election . Let that sink in . <p> If Morrison survives this crisis , he 's got three more years in the Lodge . But we need to understand Morrison 's days are numbered . The Liberal Party heavyweights will come for him soon enough . <p> Ironically , Scotty from Marketing has damaged the Liberal brand . He has wantonly spent the last shekels of goodwill in the Liberal Party coffers . He was never up to the job and he is expendable . <p> The problem we face is that , outside of heavenly intervention , the next Liberal prime minister is likely to be worse . Like the convocation of Hogwarts , it 's frightening to mention his name but he is busy gathering the Horcruxes of power behind the curtain . <p> Oh fark ...

@@71893741 <h> ' We , Health Workers , Do n't Need Ordinances . What We Need is Trust ' <p> Amid several reports of attacks on healthcare personnel engaged in treating and tracking COVID-19 cases across the country , the Cabinet , on Wednesday , 22 April , approved an ordinance to amend the Epidemic Act of 1897 , making acts of violence against health workers a cognisable and non-bailable offence , punishable with prison terms . <p> How important is this ordinance in the fight against COVID-19 ? Why is there violence against healthcare workers ( HCWs ) during this pandemic ? <p> To understand that , we need to understand the history and the sociological context of a pandemic or epidemic . Before analysing this violence and the ordinance , it needs to be reiterated that any violence is unacceptable and must be condemned . <h> ' Transactional ' Model of Healthcare Must Change <p> Violence against healthcare workers , particularly doctors and hospital staff , has been almost endemic in India , the last few decades . This growing trend mirrored the increasing privatisation of healthcare since the 1990s . Though the majority of attacks have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors , particularly resident doctors in the frontline of care in emergency rooms and ICUs , have borne the brunt . The reasons for this is multifactorial . <p> India 's predominantly privatised healthcare system is extremely inequitable and causes high degree of indebtedness among not just the poor , but also the middle class . <p> Almost 70 percent of healthcare spending in India is out-of-pocket . According to a report of a Parliamentary Standing Committee in 2016 , nearly 63 million people are pushed below the poverty line every year because of healthcare debts . <p> As the contract between private healthcare providers and patients has become more of a business deal rather than service , as is the nature of ' business deals ' everywhere , everyone wants the biggest bang for the buck . <p> In this environment , when people are forced to shell out large amounts of money for healthcare and the results are not what they expect , they take to violence . This is somewhat similar to the over-privatised model of healthcare in the US , where the violence is not physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare delivery , laws alone might not succeed in changing the increasingly confrontational relationship between healthcare providers and the people . This law goes further to put the two sections at ' war ' . <p> To begin with , the government needs to invest more than a measly 1.2 percent of India 's GDP on healthcare to reduce people 's burden of healthcare expenses . Most countries with a decent public health system in the Lower Middle Income Group ( LMICs ) to which India also belongs , spends roughly 2.5-3 percent of GDP on public health . In India , that has been an unkept promise for over a decade . <p> The violence is also related to a lack of training in communication and interpersonal behaviour among medical students and resident doctors . <p> When high stress situations in the ER or ICU take a turn for the worse , they find themselves inadequately equipped to deal with it . <p> The nature and the reasons for the violence during this pandemic are somewhat different , however . This violence is directed more towards public healthcare workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors . This arises from the stigmatisation and ostracisation of patients or suspected patients of COVID-19 , and of certain communities along the lines of religion . This has led to people feeling isolated , threatened and vulnerable . <h> COVID is an ' Invisible Enemy ' : A Dangerous Narrative <p> There is also an associated element of vigilantism against patients/suspected patients , part of a widespread and growing lynch-culture in the country . When governments and healthcare systems talk of the virus as an invisible and untreatable ' enemy ' , it has dangerous consequences . <p> The lack of understanding , irrationality and fear that it generates , leads a section of people to find a ' visible enemy ' to attack . <p> The war rhetoric used by governments has made a difficult situation worse .

Measures carried out under this Act included mass sanitation , stopping of social and religious gatherings , social distancing , invasion of private property to search for plague suspects , etc . <p> As historian and author David Arnold ( Colonizing the Body : State Medicine and Epidemic Disease in Nineteenth-Century India ) says , " Never before had the State in India intervened so directly and forcefully in the lives of the Indian people .

We do not need more ordinances and laws to protect us .

It 's actually one of the most common types of phobias , and yet it 's hardly talked about , nor is there much research on it .

Now let 's spread the truth about TP shortages and wipe out TP hoarding fallacy . Following are two logical causes for TP shortage : one caused by manufacturing and distribution problems , the second caused by millions of people with medical conditions dependent on having substantial TP supply on hand . There 's just no substitute for TP unless the homeowner installs a bidet . <p> A TV segment explained the dynamics of virtually the entire U.S. population ( except essential workers ) now " going " at home . Before the shutdown , humans were " going " elsewhere , schools , restaurants , work and entertainment venues . Millions using industrial grade TP . <p> Advertisement <p> Those places stopped ordering toilet paper . Now grocery stores place huge orders for soft TP for home use . This is major about-face for the TP industry flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required retooling to make home use TP , packaging , printing and restructure logistics shipping to new routes . Industry is a lumbering giant , not nimble on its feet . Thus empty shelves . More and more stores are or should be stocked now . <p> It was the same problem for manufacturers of pasta , spaghetti sauce and sanitizing products . They formerly supplied schools and restaurants but suddenly found themselves scrambling to deliver to grocery stores . I presume many people are supplying neighbors and food pantries , so stop judging grocery cart contents . <p> Advertisement <p> Sure , preppers and scammers are instilling fear and gambling they will make a killing creating a TP black market luring gullible people . As for serious hoarding , how many people do you know with garage/basement , spare room or warehouse full of contraband TP ? Are TP trucks being hijacked ? <p> There is a second explanation for the toilet paper shortage that ca n't be flushed away . <p> Jimmy Kimmel Live frequently mentions Crohn 's &amp; Colitiis Foundation 's recent challenge to stack up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Crohn 's , one of myriad of inflammatory bowel diseases .

Immodium might be the answer for that , but not for Crohn 's sufferers with blockage . You 'd risk bowel perforation . <p> How serious ? Turns out deadly serious . The Carroll County Times told the story of young , healthy-looking man who died in a cell without screaming in pain at the Carroll County Detention Center on Feb. 5 when an ulcer ate through his intestinal wall . <p> People are embarrassed to talk about bowel issues . Many are held captive by constant vulnerability to disease that gives little warning of attack .

@@71920141 <h> ' Bizarre ' omission of pharmacy in collaboration <h> Medicines adherence is one of five key areas of focus for a new Continuity of Care Collaboration -- but pharmacy has been left out in the cold <p> In what it calls an " unprecedented " move , a collaboration of 15 Australian health organisations have joined hands to actively support those living with chronic health conditions to manage and monitor their health , and to advocate for preventative health during the COVID-19 pandemic and minimise the post COVID-19 community health legacy . <p> The group was formed amid " mounting " concerns that Australians have not been maintaining their regular health care visits for existing chronic conditions , or delaying seeing a doctor about testing , vaccination or investigation of concerns due to worry about contracting COVID-19 , or about over-burdening the health system . <p> The Collaboration says that patient safety and continuity of care has never been more important , and Pathology Awareness Australia 's John Crothers noted that several weeks ago , laboratory testing had plunged by 40% . <p> " The aim of the CCC is for each of the 15 organisations to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch on their ongoing health care and maintenance , and to not allow the ongoing COVID-19 crisis to prevent crucial healthcare interactions such as seeing your general practice team , allied health professional , pharmacist or receiving important tests , " it said in a statement . <p> " The CCC will engage with Federal and State Governments and Departments of Health to keep patients safe during COVID-19 whilst moving the continuity of care agenda forward . " <p> But Anthony Tassone , Victorian branch president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia , expressed surprise and disappointment that there was no inclusion of any pharmacy organisation in the collaboration . <p> " It is truly bizarre that any collaboration looking at medication adherence for patient care would exclude peak pharmacy organisations , " he told the AJP . <p> " Whether it was by accident or design -- it is a mistake that will undermine any success this initiative ever hopes to achieve . <p> " Sadly , through this glaring omission it seems that despite the best of intentions , this collaboration are potentially setting themselves up for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the room , and pharmacists are the undisputed medicine experts as part of an interprofessional team of health care professionals . " <p> Mr Tassone said that without the best team of health care professionals working together to enhance patient care , patients themselves will not see the benefits such a collaboration could bring . <p> " Furthermore , with vaccinations being a key focus of this collaboration -- it is imperative that pharmacy is included given the record number of flu vaccinations already delivered through community pharmacy this year , " he said . <p> Elizabeth de Somer , CEO of Medicines Australia , noted that medicines were a key aspect of continuity of care . <p> " Patients need to continue with their regular general practice visits , pathology testing , vaccinations and taking medications , as we want to ensure that peoples ' health is managed not only for now but also in the long-term , " she said in the CCC 's statement . <p> She added in a statement from MA that " From a pharmaceutical perspective , medication adherence is important for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and wellbeing " . <p> Anthony Tassone said that medicines adherence has also been a key focus for Australia 's pharmacists during the pandemic . <p> " COVID-19 has posed great challenges for patient adherence and continuity of care , and if it was not for the dedicated work of the 5700-plus community pharmacy network across Australia keeping their doors open and going the extra mile to do whatever it took to ensure patients did not go without whenever possible -- the situation could have been a lot worse , " he said . <p> " The Guild stands ready to collaborate on any initiative that involves working as part of an interprofessional team to further improve patient care . <h> AJP Daily Newsletter <h> APP Online 2020 <p> Backlash after pharmacists left out of life assurance scheme ; NZ pharmacies in financial peril ; Welsh pharmacy calls police on English patient UK : Following outrage that pharmacists were not automatically included ... <h> Clinical Tips <h> ajp.com.au <p> This web site is intended for Australian pharmacy professionals and is not a substitute for independent professional advice .

However , while almost everyone is equipped with masks in Hong Kong , it is a rare sight to see people wearing masks in America . <p> This was true even before the coronavirus pandemic began . The general public in Hong Kong wear masks if they feel unwell , to protect themselves during the flu season or to go to a clinic , but Americans do not . <p> " It is not very common to see people wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Mexico . <p> " I was mainly exposed to people wearing masks on international flights and sometimes domestic travel . " <p> For Howell , wearing masks identifies people as sick or protecting themselves from getting sick - an extreme practice . " The rareness of wearing masks made it seem not totally necessary . I always felt it was a more extreme form of protection , " she said . <p> That sentiment was reflected in American society too . Rather than wearing masks to prevent the flu , Americans tend to use other methods . <p> Harvard School of Public Health polls in May 2009 showed that when the swine flu pandemic happened , 67 percent of respondents washed their hands or used hand sanitizer more frequently , 55 percent made preparations to stay at home if they or their family member were sick and 35 percent took steps to avoid being near someone with flu-like symptoms . However , only 4 percent said they wore a mask . <p> There are many reasons for this . Hung Yu-wen , a former master of sciences student from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2018 . She concluded that masks could create social barriers and be unpleasant to wear based on responses from the study 's 84 participants . <p> " Most participants believed wearing masks were barriers in social interaction , " wrote Hung . <p> " Covering the face affects emotional signals . People may be perceived as less friendly while their faces are covered . " She also pointed out that wearing masks might cause people to criticize them about being in public while ill . <p> " There appears to be a kind of fear of drawing negative attention . The participants cited concerns about discrimination due to the presence of a mask . " <p> Just wearing masks is another concern . " Most of the participants were not satisfied with the experience of wearing face masks , " said Hung . <p> " They believed the appearance of face masks was unattractive , and wearers reported frequent problems related to the moisture , airflow , and thermal properties of the masks . " <p> Apart from beliefs about wearing masks cited by the study , public education has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two regions . <p> Cheris Chan , associate professor of sociology at the University of Hong Kong , credits the practice of wearing masks here to the SARS outbreak in 2003 . <p> " Before SARS , mask-wearing was not a norm among Hong Kong people , " she said . " The idea was not widely transmitted to the public until the outbreak of SARS . " <p> She said medical experts started educating the public about the importance of masks in 2003 . " Since then , Hong Kong people are more aware of the function of masks , and wear them when they are sick , during the flu season , or when visiting hospitals . " <p> Like Hong Kong , the United States also experienced swine flu in 2009 , with 275,000 hospitalised and 12,000 deaths , said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . <p> However , even after the swine flu outbreak passed , American public education did not stress the importance of masks . <p> Howell said she was never educated about the need to wear a mask . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in my spare time . I did not know anyone who wore a mask and could teach me about its effectiveness . " <p> Jamison Leid from Saint Louis had the same view . " Growing up , I was never formally instructed on masks , like how to wear one or the appropriate usage , " he said . " So masks always felt like an accessory and not a way to manage the spread of an infection . " <p> For Covid-19 , while Hong Kong experts are stressing the necessity of masks in protection , the CDC says the opposite , writing on its website that " no recommendation can be made at this time for mask use in the community by asymptomatic persons . " <p> People who need masks are " coughing patients and anyone suspected of having influenza " and " health-care personnel who are within six feet of a suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza patient . " <p> Like during the swine flu outbreak , the CDC said that emphasis should be placed on other strategies , " including pharmaceutical , community measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as well as measures like social distancing , school closures and routine surface cleaning . <p> The regional differences in wearing masks occur not only in Hong Kong and the United States , but also in countries across the world . <p> For example , the Japanese consider wearing a mask a sign of consideration for other people and a form of social responsibility . <p> But a member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies , Matteo Dall'Osso , was laughed at when he wore a mask at a meeting .

So far , significant measures have been taken to follow this advice , with major conferences and gatherings around the world being cancelled to mitigate the spread of the virus , from Mobile World Congress to Google I/O . <p> Many employees around the world are also having to work remotely . This disruption has , in some cases , been helped by the implementation of video conferencing technologies such as Zoom , Google Hangouts and Microsoft Teams , as well as the use of other communication and collaboration tools such as Slack , Trello and Asana . <p> Here , we take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start-ups that may be used to limit the spread of Covid-19 and solve other problems that have arisen as the world responds to the virus . <h> The basics <p> The main advice imparted to the public by the WHO , the HSE , the CDC , the NHS and other health organisations is that everybody should be focused on washing their hands thoroughly and correctly to prevent the spread of Covid-19 . <p> Trinity College Dublin start-up SureWash previously developed a clinical hand-wash hygiene training app , which is used to teach nurses , doctors and other medical professionals how to wash their hands in the workplace . The app can be used to gather data on competence in staff hand-washing and hygiene . SureWash has recently updated the app , which can be downloaded to smartphones , in light of the spread of Covid-19 . <p> Another piece of advice is to try mitigate the spread of germs .

According to Chan , Run The World has responded to the Covid-19 crisis by waiving all set-up fees for any conference affected by the virus . <p> Wired also featured another start-up , Hopin , which combines livestreamed presentations with a virtual networking feature that enables attendees to meet each other .

The toll on the meat-processing industry has stunned some of industry 's biggest players , and prompted an urgent push to redefine workplace protections needed to keep products flowing into grocery stores . <p> In Washington , in addition to the coronavirus outbreak at Tyson , the Washington Beef plant in Toppenish in Yakima County has had 38 cases of COVID-19 , including one death and two hospitalizations . Nationally , an investigation by USA Today and the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting found 3,400 confirmed COVID-19 infections at 62 plants that had resulted in at least 17 worker deaths . <p> As protesters rally in Washington and other states to pressure governors to open more businesses , meat processors have been under pressures in some communities where they operate to temporarily close . <p> Advertising <p> They also are facing scrutiny for their market conduct .

In an April 6 letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue , Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer requested that an ongoing federal investigation of beef pricing margins be expanded to look for market manipulations or other signs of unfair practices during the pandemic . <p> Still , the COVID-19 outbreaks also are taking a financial toll on processors . Tyson Foods , the Arkansas-based meat processing giant which last year posted more than $42 billion in annual revenues , has had to slow some operations and temporarily shut down others , including a closure announced this week of its largest pork facility in Waterloo , Iowa . <h> Tyson plant to pause and test <p> In Washington , county health officials have required Tyson , which typically has a workforce of more than 1,400 at the Wallula plant , to test all employees coronavirus .

The Walla Walla Department of Community Health has been in daily contact with Tyson , developing coronavirus safety guidelines and conducting inspections . <p> Advertising <p> " They , like everyone else , have learned as they go , " said Meghan Debolt , the director of the Walla Walla County health department . " Honestly , I think Tyson was a little bit slow to implement .

She asked what special precautions were in place at the plant and was dismayed by his response . <p> " There was nothing . It was business as usual , " Olivera said . <p> " Something is not right that this has been allowed to get so far out of control , " said Erik Nicholson , national vice president of the United Farm Workers labor union . <h> A shortage of workers <p> Corral , who was born in Chicago and spent his youth in Mexico , went to work at the Wallula plant as a teenager . Today , the 39-year-old worker earns nearly $19 an hour with benefits that include a month of paid vacation . <p> For years , this Wallula plant has been one of the largest employers in Walla Walla County , and has offered immigrants from many different countries a place to draw a steady paycheck . The plant has at times had union representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation by the United Food and Commercial Workers . <p> The plant sits next to a vast " restricted holding facility " where cattle mill about in close quarters before being sent to slaughter . In normal operations , Corral works in another part of the plant , where he cuts up carcasses . <p> So far , Corral has maintained his health , and has stayed on the job even as many co-workers opted to stay home . The facility , during normal operations , processes enough beef each day to feed 4 million people , according to the company . And Corral takes pride in his support of that effort . <p> Advertising <p> " I do n't want to have a shortage of food later , " he said . " That 's my motivation . I feel like my job produces something that benefits the community . " <p> Through the weeks , Corral said more and more workers disappeared from the lines .

She has been able to keep her children healthy , but six family members at her father-in-law 's house recently tested positive for the virus . <p> In Pasco , a worker from Southeast Asia has been off work since April 13 , and continues to struggle with high fevers and body aches from a bout of COVID-19 that has robbed him of his appetite .

After the first several days of being ill , Mendoza appeared to be on the mend and he regained his appetite . Then he tested positive for the virus , and the disease soon migrated to his lungs .

Olivera took a circuitous route to the hospital to avoid marchers , and arrived to find her father fading and unresponsive . <p> Through this April ordeal , Olivera said Tyson management stayed in touch with the family , and recently offered condolences .

Contrast that with what happened under the Obama administration , when the employee side of the payroll tax was cut from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent . <p> Larry Kudlow , the director of the National Economic Council , made assurances at a briefing from the Coronavirus Task Force that the Social Security trust fund would be replenished through general revenues . But that would be a lot of backfilling : Garrett Watson of the Tax Foundation estimated a full payroll tax holiday from April through December would cost as much as $975 billion , based on a CBO projection that the payroll tax would raise some $1.3 trillion in 2020 . ( Some estimates put a potential nine-month full holiday even higher . ) <p> So now what ? It 's probably fair to say that the administration has some hurdles to clear to get a payroll tax cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How excited is the GOP-led Senate about the payroll tax cut idea ? Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) said it 'd be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) to get a deal , in an acknowledgement of how much leverage Democrats have over any potential deal . <p> Still : As Rep. Tom Cole ( R-Okla. ) noted , no one should be surprised if Republicans rally around Trump , and it is n't yet clear what the president is willing to give up to get that kind of tax relief . <p> For their part , House Democrats are plowing ahead on their own measure , which could get a vote as soon as this week . And while Democrats have almost universally pooh-poohed a payroll tax cut for this particular situation , House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal ( D-Mass. ) said he would talk with Mnuchin on Wednesday , after the Treasury secretary sat down with Pelosi on Tuesday . <p> TAKE A RIDE ?

But the inclusion of the retail glitch begs a question : Could a new stimulus offer a ride to tax provisions that have so far stalled in Congress ? <p> It 's tough to know how serious discussions are over the retail glitch , though one source said that companies have been invited to discuss the issue with the White House .

Why the big jump ? ITEP says a big part of it was from states like California and Massachusetts , which both started legal recreational sales in 2018 , straightening out some early issues in getting their markets up and running . <p> In all , California now raises about a third of the excise and sales tax revenue raised by recreational cannabis , even as the amount it raises per capita is less than in states like Washington and Colorado . <p> All well and good , but Davis also expressed some concern that revenues could start to decline in the years to come , due to a combination of sales leveling off and marijuana prices dropping . That 's the risk states run , ITEP argues , by largely basing their taxing structure for cannabis on price , instead of benchmarks like weight or amount sold .

Thank you . Please go ahead , sir . <p> Thank you , operator . Good afternoon , and welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Jason Shandell , President of Amphastar . I 'm joined today by our CFO , Bill Peters . We appreciate you joining us on the call today and look forward to speaking with you and answering any questions you may have . <p> As you can see from our financial results , Amphastar had a strong year and is in a position of operational and financial strength , driven by continued execution of our long-term strategy and focus on our key growth drivers and complex pipeline . <p> Our net revenues for 2019 increased by more than 9% to approximately $322 million and our gross profit increased more than 23% to approximately $132 million driven by strong sales of Primatene Mist and our critical care portfolio , which continues to show strong demand due to competitor shortages . <p> Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $41.8 million . Gross margins also increased year-over-year from 36% to 41% , as Primatene Mist and our other high-margin products continue to increase as a percentage of our total sales . We expect this margin expansion trend to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments in research and development will allow us to deliver even greater value to patients and shareholders over the long term . <p> Since our last earnings call , I 'm happy to announce that the FDA has accepted 2 more ANDAs , which have GDUFA dates in the fourth quarter of 2020 . One of the ANDAs is for regadenoson , which is a generic of Lexiscan . This ANDA included a Paragraph IV certification , and we were sued by the brand sponsor , which triggered a 30-month stay . We now have 7 ANDAs on file with the agency , targeting products with a market size of approximately $1.9 billion based on IQVIA data for the 12 months ended December 31 , 2019 . <p> The strong momentum of Primatene Mist sales continues to increase at a greater rate as we launched the product into Walmart in November 2019 , and we continue to increase consumer awareness through our marketing strategies . As we discussed on the last earnings call , traditional television advertising has been extremely effective in building consumer awareness about Primatene Mist . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels and saw a very good return on investment . Therefore , beginning in January 2020 , we expanded airing of our commercials on the major broadcast networks , targeting prime yet cost-effective advertising slots with the national recognized TV shows , including Judge Judy , Dr. Phil , The Price Is Right and many other widely viewed programs . This strong advertising push , combined with an allergy season that arrived earlier due to the mild winter , resulted in very strong same-store sales across all of our retail partners . <p> Weekly store sales as of the last week of the fourth quarter of 2019 have increased by more than 140% compared to the first week of the third quarter 2019 , which was just before the TV ads began airing . We are very excited about the long-term prospects of this brand and are currently in discussions with other large potential retail partners . Based on the continued effectiveness of our advertising strategy and the continued positive trend in retail store sales , we maintain our guidance of Primatene Mist achieving an annual rate of revenue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products from our IMS facility to be another strong driver of revenues in 2020 . We recently issued a press release announcing that the FDA approved our supplemental ANDA for sodium bicarbonate , which is for manufacturing the product in our new state-of-the-art production line at IMS . This FDA approval further validates our strength in scaling up our manufacturing capabilities in response to increased demand for our products and greatly increases our manufacturing capacity at our IMS facility . Our recent approval will help us meet the high demand for our critical care injectable products and provide us with capacity for future pipeline products , which will be a source of significant revenues going forward . <p> With respect to our epinephrine 30-ml vial ANDA , we received a minor CRL in January 2020 and responded to the agency in 1 business day . As a result , we have a GDUFA date in the second quarter of 2020 and are confident that we will receive approval . Regarding our complex injectable product , which has been through 3 review cycles of the agency , we received the CRL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 . As a result , we have a new GDUFA date in Q3 or Q4 2020 , depending if another pre-approval inspection is needed . <p> As we discussed on our last earnings call , we have another ANDA on file with the FDA for a very complex injectable product that is off-patent and has never had generic competition due to its complexity . We had a productive mid-cycle review meeting with the agency earlier this year and have a GDUFA date for this product in the second quarter 2020 . <p> With respect to our insulin programs , our first human clinical trials using our insulin began in Q4 2019 and is ongoing . Based on recent FDA guidance and direct communications with the agency , we remain hopeful that our strong analytical tools , including characterization of complex molecules , will result in the FDA determining that immunogenicity studies would not be required . This determination would save significant time and expenses , thereby allowing us to enter the market sooner than previously expected . Furthermore , based on recent FDA guidance and the purity of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve interchangeable status for our insulin products . <p> Turning to our intranasal naloxone NDA . We have a meeting with the agency scheduled for later this month . The purpose of this meeting is to confirm with the agency that we 've addressed all of the issues identified in the CRL and FDA 's general advice letters . If the agency agrees that we 've addressed all issues , we could resubmit the NDA this year . <p> Finally , I would like to address the impact of the coronavirus on Amphastar . At this time , over 99% of the labor force in our China facility has returned to work , and thankfully , none of our employees have contracted the virus . Furthermore , our supply chain is well intact as we had previously built up significant inventory of starting material and API from China as we strategically planned for potential disruptions related to trade negotiations and the African swine flu . As a result of these planning efforts , we have at least 2 years inventory of starting material and API located in our California facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. Furthermore , it should be emphasized that Amphastar manufactures all of our finished products in the United States , which further insulates the company 's commercial operations from supply disruptions related to global instability . <p> I will now turn the call over to Bill to go through the fourth quarter financial results . <p> Thank you , Jason . Sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased 7% to $83.4 million from $89.7 million in the previous year 's period . Importantly , Primatene Mist achieved a very strong sales of $9 million as we loaded our product nationally into Walmart and had large orders from all of the other national drugstore chains . Enoxaparin sales dropped to $8.8 million in the fourth quarter from $19.1 million in the prior year 's fourth quarter as a market shortage in 2018 resulted in a temporary surge in enoxaparin sales last year . <p> Gross margins improved to 40% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 from 39% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to sales of higher-margin products such as Primatene Mist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million from $2.6 million on television and radio expenses for marketing Primatene Mist . General and administrative spending decreased 24% to $10.5 million from $13.8 million primarily due to decreased legal expenses since we settled our lawsuit with Momenta and Sandoz in June of 2019 . Research and development expenditures increased 17% to $19.6 million from $16.7 million due to increased clinical trial expenses for inhalation products and increased expenses associated with API development at our Amphastar Nanjing Pharmaceuticals subsidiary . <p> The company reported a net loss of $1 million or $0.02 per share compared to last year 's fourth quarter net income of $1.9 million or $0.04 per share . The company reported adjusted net income of $3.6 million or $0.07 per share compared to an adjusted net income of approximately $6.2 million or $0.13 per share in the fourth quarter of last year . Adjusted earnings include -- or exclude amortization , equity compensation , impairments and onetime events . <p> In the fourth quarter , we had cash flows provided by operations of approximately $5.7 million . During the quarter , the company repurchased approximately $13.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to over $22 million . <p> Let me review a few of the financial assumptions that we are using as we look to 2020 . We expect sales growth to be driven by Primatene Mist and 1 or 2 ANDAS , which may be approved later this year . Our sales have already gotten a boost this year from the approval of the supplemental ANDA for sodium bicarbonate , which effectively increases the capacity for prefilled syringes , many of which are in drug shortage by allowing us to manufacture in our newly modernized facility . We have already begun shipping product from this new room and believe that the sales opportunity for these shortage products is approximately $20 million annually . We expect additional sales growth to come from our ANP subsidiary . Last year , we booked $1.5 million in third-party sales from our ANP business . And at this time , we believe that sales from this facility will more than double in 2020 . We expect gross margins to increase as we sell more of our high-margin Primatene Mist , and we anticipate higher margins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense will rise as we plan to increase our advertising for Primatene Mist . However , the advertising expense will decrease as a percentage of Primetime Mist sales to provide earnings leverage . We expect G&amp;A spending to decrease as a percentage of sales due to lower spending on legal matters . We expect research and development spending will continue to increase in both dollar terms and as a percentage of sales , as we currently have 2 inhalation and 1 insulin clinical trials ongoing , and we continue to increase the R&amp;D work at our ANP facility . <p> I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions and answers . <p> And then for epinephrine vials , I think you had previously indicated , we could get a response from the FDA by the end of April . Is that still the expectation ? And then if approved , how should we think about that potential market opportunity and the market share you 're targeting ? <p> Sure . So yes , we 've said that we have a GDUFA date for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of that minor CRL . And so when you do the math , that does come out to April . And in terms of market opportunity , we believe that we will be the sole generic and should have a reasonable share of the market . <p> What we 've said so far is that we had $9 million in sales in the fourth quarter . Just under $2 million of that was stocking for Walmart , and we expect significant growth this year , and we 're targeting our goal of the run rate of $65 million next year . So those are the parameters we 've given . <p> Yes . So with those parameters , the $9 million in the fourth quarter , and as I said in my prepared remarks that we just started airing on network television commercials beginning just in January . So with the Walmart launch and the push into mainstream television , we think that the growth will continue at the rate that we 've seen . <p> Two questions . You mentioned the ramp-up in DTC , a national TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon ? Or is it just this quarter ? And related to that , it looks like you 've done about $10 million in SG&amp;A each of the last 2 quarters . With this ramp up , should we expect kind of higher quarterly run rates in SG&amp;A ? And then secondly , you mentioned you have the 2 GDUFA dates this year for these large multiple $100 million branded products that do n't currently have generic . Can you give us a little more color on the timing of the current GDUFA dates as you know them ? <p> Sure . So in terms of the advertising push , yes , I think we do want to continue this throughout the year . The return on investment has been really good , and we think it will continue . And again , as I was saying in my prepared remarks that although it is the broadcast TV and national television , it 's still very cost-effective . So we 're targeting the prime yet cost-effective advertising slots . So we will continue with that . And in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes . So we have our -- we break out our G&amp;A from our selling , so the selling , distribution or marketing line . You 've seen some significant growth in that . And that growth is really all advertising for Primatene Mist . And as I said earlier , we are going to grow that -- those dollars relative this year . However , as a percentage of sales of Primatene Mist that will drop . So we will get earnings leverage on that . <p> And then in terms of the 2 undisclosed complex injectable products without generic competition , the first one that we 've been talking about for quite a while now , that 's the one that 's been through 3 review cycles . And we did a pretty fast turnaround . On the last call , we had talked about getting the CRL in the fourth quarter . And at that point , we were just assessing it , and we felt confident that it was very addressable . And we predicted that we would respond in January , which we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- we do n't give a specific date , but it is Q3 of this year . However , if there was another pre-approval inspection that was needed , then it would be Q4 . With respect to the other one that just was on file recently . This is still the first cycle review . So that one is a Q2 GDUFA date . And because it does have the competitive generic status , we had a very productive mid-cycle review meeting and got a lot of clarity through that meeting . So we are looking forward to a response on that in the second quarter . <p> So on Primatene demand , this is a promotion-sensitive product . And in this period now of more restrictive movements and social distancing , what are your thoughts on the potential impact to demand on Primatene ? Is that something you 're contemplating in any way ? That 's number one . And then number two , I joined late , so maybe I missed this , but any update on your inhalation pipeline and what portion of your file pipeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent to which you 're going to be filing later this year on inhalation generics . <p> Definitely . So yes , let 's start with Primatene . It 's really exciting . I mean , to your point , in this day and age of the coronavirus , people are reluctant to go even to their doctor 's office or into a hospital facility . And the fact that you can order either online or very quickly go into your local retailer , we 're seeing very strong demand . Actually , in San Francisco , we heard that there 's a shortage of Primatene . People are just buying up as much medicine over-the-counter as they can . So there 's sort of been a panic due to the coronavirus . And we are seeing an increase in demand . Also , we believe that increase is related to the mild winter and the early allergy season . But it is interesting . And we do believe that we have a competitive advantage as the only over-the-counter asthma inhaler . So you can avoid the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your temporary relief of intermittent asthma . <p> And then with respect to our inhalation portfolio , I know Bill has talked about some of the clinical trial expenses . And so we do have 2 generic inhalation products that are currently in ongoing clinical trials . And of those -- so right now , we do n't have any ANDAs on file . They 're actively in the clinics and going through trials , and we still are targeting filing 1 inhalation ANDA this year . <p> This is Tian on for Serge . I just had a few . So I think the FDA recently just approved the first generic for ProAir in late February . So I just wanted to get your thoughts on maybe how this might impact or compete with Primatene sales in the near term . And then in terms of other retailers for Primatene Mist , do you have any other updates regarding additional stores or even online that are being discussed at this point ? <p> Definitely , definitely . So let me address the ProAir question because it 's an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after Primatene Mist was approved in late 2018 , in early 2019 , the brands launched authorized generics . So technically , there have been generic albuterols on the market for over a year and really has not had impact to our product . Again , I think the real benefit here is because you do not need to go to the doctor . You do not need a prescription . And this is a historical phenomenon because even back during the CFC days , when albuterol is only $2 , and we were actually not promoting Primatene , there was still strong sales of $65 million . So we still feel very confident with our Primatene Mist being the only over-the-counter asthma inhaler available . And with respect to other retailers , definitely . We are currently in discussions with several retailers , and we should have updates for that in the coming quarters . <p> Thank you , operator . So I just want to , again , thank everybody for joining us today . I know it 's been a very difficult time recently with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , and we 're going to get through it . I want to make sure everybody stays healthy and safe and want everybody to realize that Amphastar continues to grow , and our China facility is strong , and we look forward to providing future updates on a go-forward basis . So we 'll talk to you soon . Thanks , everybody .

@@71833941 <p> Reserve Bank board members decided it was likely Australia 's economy would shrink across the March and June quarters -- and potentially even longer -- when it cut the cash rate to a record low 0.25 per cent to fight the impact of the coronavirus outbreak . <p> The word " recession " was not mentioned in RBA governor Philip Lowe 's address following the ad hoc March 18 board meeting , or in the speech to the media that followed the next day , but minutes show members agreed it was likely the coronavirus crisis would result in at least two back-to-back quarters of contraction . <p> This is the technical definition of a recession , something Australia has not experienced since the early 1990s . <p> The RBA neglected to give an official growth forecast when it launched its suite of economic support measures a fortnight ago but it did tip significant job losses . <p> " While it was not possible to provide an updated set of forecasts for the economy given the fluidity of the situation , it was likely that Australia would experience a very material contraction in economic activity , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " minutes from the March 18 meeting show . <p> " The size of the fall in economic activity would depend on the extent of the social distancing requirements , and potential lockdowns , put in place to contain the virus .

@@51575541 <h> Email <p> ISLAMABAD : China has asked Pakistan to open the border between the two countries for one day on Friday ( March 27 ) so that medical supplies meant to combat coronavirus could be transported . <p> The Khunjerab Pass is usually opened on April 1 which marks the end of winter in that part , but due to the global outbreak of Covid-19 , the border between Pakistan and China has been closed for an indefinite period . <p> A letter , written by the Chinese embassy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , with copies to the National Disaster Management Authority ( NDMA ) , the government of Gilgit-Baltistan and the Ministry of National Health Services , states that the governor of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China would like to donate a batch of medical materials to GB . According to the letter , the governor has donated 200,000 ordinary face masks , 2,000 N-95 face masks , five ventilators , 2,000 testing kits and 2,000 medical protective clothes mainly used by doctors and paramedics . <p> The donation is in response to a request made by GB Chief Minister Hafeezur Rehman to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The materials are ready to be delivered to GB through Khunjerab Pass at 9am Pakistan time on March 27 . Therefore , it is requested to temporarily open border the same date . In this regard , it is also highly recommended that Pakistani side should agree and make due preparation before the date so that all materials could enter Pakistan smoothly , " said the Chinese embassy 's letter . <p> Gilgit-Baltistan has high percentage of coronavirus cases in the country compared to its population , but the underdeveloped region has a negligible number of operational ventilators and remoteness has led to a severe shortage of medical equipments . <p> Earlier , NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Mohammad Afzal had said at a media briefing that protection kits and other necessary equipments being donated by China would reach Pakistan on March 28 . He added that Pakistan had sought to purchase medical equipments , including ventilators , but these were in short supply around the world and only China had assured that it would provide such items to Pakistan . <p> The Chinese embassy has also stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of porters to unload the cargo is needed . <p> Under a border protocol agreement of 1985 , the Khunjerab border crossing remains closed from the end of November to April . Trade and travel activities between the two countries take place through Khunjerab Pass , also known as Sust Dry Port -- the only land route between China and Pakistan . <p> Meanwhile , a GB government official told Dawn that the relevant federal agencies , including the National Logistic Cell , customs department and Federal Intelligence Agency , suggested to the GB government on Wednesday that the supplies might be imported using C-130 cargo aircraft since making arrangements for one day only might be difficult because there was no indication that the Sust border crossing would be opened from April 1 . <p> However , no decision has been so far taken by the federal government in this regard . <h> Comments ( 104 ) Closed <p> Again .. what are they exporting from China to Pakistan ?

To an extent , fashion was a natural choice : her grandfather Matt Cochrane ran a gents ' outfitters in Moate ; her uncle Danny and his wife Olivia ( of Olivia Danielle ) have both carried on the tradition and her cousin runs " Danny 's " in Limerick . <p> " I moved to New York pretty much after college , in June , initially for five months , and then I came back to Mullingar until July the next year and I worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America after that and I 've been here since , " says Katie . <p> Asked which she prefers -- New York or LA -- Katie pauses for a second : " I probably prefer New York : there is a good buzz ; the city is alive , there is a great hustle and bustle -- it 's an amazing city . <p> " But then Los Angeles has its benefits , it 's beautiful , you can go hiking in the mountains or go to the sea all on the same day , " <p> There are n't as many Irish around Los Angeles : " In New York there were loads , but in Los Angeles , not as many although I 'm sure if you are in different neighbourhoods there might be -- I know there is a community on the west side and they play Gaelic , they have the ' Gaelic Cougars ' .

Why ca n't we respect nature , preserve the forest , protect the environment and its wildlife ? The answer is easy . It is because of human greed . It is an insatiable , unquenchable drive beyond control . To stop the greed and trafficking of wildlife and the crossover of animal-borne viruses to humans , the authorities worldwide must go after the traffickers and traders of wildlife . They must identify their bank accounts and confiscate their property , assets and money and jail the big-time traders . It is essential to ban all sale and trading in wildlife .

We are attaching a copy of the official request that was signed and posted to the Connacht secretary . <p> " We would like to ask all club delegates to think about the following : <p> " Why have clubs not been officially informed by the Connacht Secretary since 10th March that the 10 members who stepped away requested an EGM ? <p> " Why has no official from Connacht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is the EGM requested on March 10th going to be facilitated . If not , why not ? <p> " We stepped away until answers are given to the questions that you the delegates and we the executive have been asking since December . <p> " Why has the chairperson refused to answer any queries regarding the Garda report she made alleging misappropriation of Mayo LGFA funds in December ? <p> " Why are answers not forthcoming on the ? 19,300 written down to senior management in 2019 ? <p> " Why is there such a rush to replace the executives that stepped away ? <p> " Clubs now need to decide which EGM goes ahead : <p> 1 . The one requested by the 10 executive members on March 10th where we get clarity on outstanding issues and move forward and enforce procedures , transparency and accountability ; or <p> 2 . The EGM requested by the Connacht secretary to elect a new executive .

" Obviously our first priority is to make sure that our staff and our students are safe . " <p> Ian Hanigan , a spokesman for the Orange County Department of Education , said Thurmond 's message " sounds in line with some of the governor 's previous statements suggesting that campuses might not reopen before summer break .

@@41906941 <p> While we are all reading up on the Covid-19 novel coronavirus outbreak in Malaysia and know the efforts that our front-liners have taken for the sake of our safety , are any of you familiar with how Malaysia also handled a similar outbreak that captured international headlines way back in 2003 ? <p> What is SARS ? <p> That 's right , today while you duduk rumah , let us take you way back to the SARS outbreak that similarly , like the Covid-19 pandemic today , seized Malaysia during the beginning of the new millennium . For those of you who vaguely remember it and for those of you who only know it by name , SARS , or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus named SARS-associated coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) . <p> The virus was first found in the Guangdong province in China during November of 2002 . By 10th February 2003 , Chinese authorities had reported to the World Health Organisation that over 305 cases of SARS were found within their nation , as well as five deaths . <p> But that was only the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , infecting over 8,000 people and killing at least 774 people , according to the UK 's National Health Service . <p> Cases of SARS were identified by flu-like symptoms that include fevers , sudden fatigue , muscle pains , headaches , and diarrhea , all of which often take two to seven days to set in . <p> SARS in Malaysia <p> While SARS did eventually wind up reaching Malaysian shores , the cases that we recorded were actually drastically lower than that of our neighbour , Singapore . During the SARS crisis , which lasted from 2003 to 2004 , Malaysia only recorded five probable cases and two deaths , while Singapore recorded over 238 cases and 33 deaths . <p> But what exactly did Malaysia do during that period of time , and what measures did we take to prevent the SARS outbreak from spreading in our nation ? <p> What did Malaysia do during the SARS outbreak ? <p> If one were to look at the containment methods used during the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the ones that are being used now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Malaysia recorded low numbers of cases locally , more effort was put into early detection , contact surveillance , and screening activities , as this paper from the World Health Organisation states . <p> The first most important step made by the government at the time was to set up a National SARS Operations Room on 16th March 2003 , which enables the government to receive reports of SARS cases in Malaysia . Which means all suspected cases of SARS in Malaysia had to be notified to the authorities immediately , much like what we 're doing now ! <p> Probable SARS carriers will be instructed to self-quarantine at home for 10 days and remain in active contact with healthcare officials . Sounds familiar , right ? <p> A nationwide awareness campaign was also held to inform the public of the SARS outbreak , as well as daily press briefings with local and international media on decisions made to contain the virus . <p> In terms of travel restrictions , Malaysia also enforced a number of drastic changes to ensure that those that came from countries that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from entering Malaysia altogether . These regulations included : <p> Prohibiting entry of tourists from countries that were most heavily affected by the virus , which included China , Hong Kong , Vietnam , Taiwan and Canada . However , the ban , which was enforced in 10th April 2003 , was then lifted after a week . <p> Chinese &amp; Vietnamese visa applications to Malaysia had to be submitted with medical reports that showed applicants did not suffer from SARS in the past seven days . <p> Thermal scanners were installed at all international entry points into Malaysia to screen for suspected SARS cases . <p> All arriving passengers had to fill in health declaration cards that showed their country of origin and whether they displayed symptoms of SARS . <p> As you can imagine , a global health crisis like that would require a proper team of healthcare professionals to handle in Malaysia . So of course , the Ministry of Health responded swiftly ! <p> Over 21 hospitals were designated to treat suspected cases of SARS in Malaysia . <p> All suspected cases of SARS were admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each hospital involved had to have a dedicated SARS team on call . <p> Patients were only discharged on the condition that they no longer exhibited high fevers , coughing , and if their chest X-rays and laboratory tests showed a clean bill of health for 72 hours . <p> Even then , they still had to be quarantined upon discharge for up to 10 days , and had to report back to their hospitals if any fevers develop ! See how careful our Ministry was ? <p> The End of The Storm &amp; How It Reflects On Us Today <p> By 5th July 2003 , the World Health Organisation declared that the SARS outbreak had been contained , but pockets of cases continued to be identified in China up to May 2004 . In total , five cases were only found in Malaysia , with two deaths reported . <p> It is worth noting however that despite also being a coronavirus , the spread of Covid-19 and that of SARS is wildly different , with public health expert Khor Swee Kheng telling South China Morning Press that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what happened 17 years ago . <p> " This is for several reasons : Covid-19 the disease caused by the coronavirus has infected many more people than either Sars or Nipah , it has affected many more countries , and the world is more interconnected in 2020 than 2003 or 1999 . " <p> He also observes the fact that the mitigation of the rising number of Covid-19 cases can only be hampered if Malaysians continue to cooperate and adhered to the Movement Control Order . <p> But given the fact that Malaysians are still flouting official calls to stay home , this may prove to be more difficult for Malaysia than it is for countries like Italy , where a slight drop in the percentage of cases has been reported since their nationwide lockdown .

@@51570041 <h> Welcome , Biintigen to my Gardening Posts ! <p> Some of you may know me as Shy-Anne Hovorka , the former singer/songwriter and now an educator . ( Technically , I am now a Bartlett through marriage ! ) I spent over 10 years as a full-time musician touring all over the place . It was fun ! Then , I wanted to settle down and be here for my family , thus jumping into education -- I 'm also a humanitarian , and avid environmentalist . <p> As a mother and wife , I wanted to grow the best , chemical-free , highly nutritious food I possibly could for my son , husband and me . <p> So , I decided to become a vegetable gardener ! We have successfully been gardening for over a decade with the last 4 years eating only our own vegetables year-round . We do not use chemical fertilizer and grow our food as naturally as possible . I will be covering seeds , times to plant , what to plant , starting seeds indoors and/or in a greenhouse , organizing your garden , understanding your soil , composting , storing food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously harvesting your crops over the next few months through weekly posts/videos . <p> In light of the Covid-19 , I wanted to do something to help outside of just social distancing myself and family . I decided that sharing what I know about growing fresh food at home could be useful to some of you . I have also been asked many times over the last few weeks questions regarding gardening , so I thought I would just start sharing publicly in a place for all to see . In addition to this , growing your own food is rewarding , and a great activity to include your kids in if you are in the situation of home-schooling due to Covid-19 as I am ! It is also a great way to get fresh air , exercise , grow to love your food , reconnect with the environment , reconnect with food , grow an appreciation for how food grows , it is a great stress reliever , and it is just nice to get your hands dirty sometimes ( especially with kids ) . <p> I will include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly . I will respond as soon as I possibly can with each question . If I do n't have the answer , I will seek out the response from other professional gardeners that I know . If the same question pops up multiple times , I will focus on that topic the following week . I will create a new blog with pictures and video links ( as available ) once a week . Please , ask questions ! I also have a video as well with basically the same info , but some people like to watch , and others like to read ! Your choice ! The video might show things a bit better as I only have a few pictures here . Would you believe that the picture above has over 100 little seedlings in it ? You do n't need a ton of space to start , but a large window with south/west exposure or a good grow light is needed . <p> In the last few weeks , I have been asking when to start specific seeds . Here is a snapshot of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also ! I plant by following the moon cycle . I always try to plant my seeds 4-5 days before the full moon . <h> WAIT ! ! ! Another disclaimer here ! ! ! I live in Northern Ontario ! So , this is a planting guide for short growing seasons ! If you live further South , your ability to plant in the ground is earlier . However , plants usually take a specific amount of time to grow ... so keep that in mind ! <p> My best advice for the beginner is to Start Small ! ! ! This can be overwhelming if you start too much too soon ! <p> January : ( ok , I know ... long gone ... but for the future ) <p> Peppers -- You can plant these in February , or even March , but you will be waiting until VERY late in the summer ( possibly fall ) until you get some . <p> Herbs -- Everything but basil for the most part . <p> February : ( Again , gone , but for next year . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these in March if you want , and even April will have success in getting fruit . However , I like to eat tomatoes in late June and July when my cucumbers and salads are at their best . If you plant tomatoes in February , you are eating yummy , ripe tomatoes off the vine in the summer , and are less likely to have multiple boxes of green tomatoes in the fall ripening under your bed to escape frost and slugs ! <p> March : <p> Kale <p> Broccoli <p> Cabbage <p> Kohlrabi <p> Swiss Chard <p> Basil ( NOW you can start your basil ... ) <p> ( You may want to start some lettuce , and keep planting a couple more every 2 weeks to have staggered lettuce instead of all at once . ) <p> April ( The month of the Gourds ! ) <p> Any squash <p> Pumpkins <p> Cucumbers <p> Zucchini <p> Brussel sprouts <p> Watermelon <p> Cantaloupe <p> Honeydew <p> Marigolds ( to keep pests out of the garden ! ) <p> May <p> Corn <p> Green pole beans <p> Yellow pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they do ok on their own planted by seed in June . ) <p> Late May : ( Sow directly in the garden ) <p> Spinach <p> Radish <p> Lettuce <p> So ... by the end of May , your greenhouse or house windows are overloaded with plants ! ! ! The following can be planted in the ground in early June . <p> June ( Seed directly into the ground or into pots/containers . It 's fine if still frost forecasted . ) <p> Potatoes <p> Turnip <p> Rutabaga <p> Beets <p> Carrots <p> Onions <p> Peas <p> I also grow asparagus and garlic , but they are a different beast altogether . Garlic takes 2 years from seed , 1 year from the bulb , but must be planted in the fall . An asparagus bed takes work to make , and takes 4 years to mature to eat , but totally worth it if you have the space ! <p> You can start your seeds in little 6-pack pots ( as shown in the pictures below ) or a bunch of seeds spread apart ( plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gourds ! They do n't like that ! ) and separate them later . Or , you can try the Jiffy mini-greenhouse with the little pods . However , make SURE you use seed soil . Some soils are too rich and your seeds will have difficulty germinating . They are like babies ... they only need essentials , nothing too fortified with a variety of things for the first bit , and like babies , they will need solid food soon enough ... thus a different , more beefed up soil . This too will be a blog of its own later . There are also links to some of the products I have chatted about below . <p> An example of planting seeds in the 6 pack ... can be a 10 pack , or 4 pack , but keep things small to start for the comfort of your home , and then all plants have more light as they are in smaller areas.This is an example of plot seeding . These are 2 week old broccoli . Yummy ! ! You ca n't let them get much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jiffy Greenhouse . Can start up to 72 plants in such a small space . Great for that reason . You can see this better in the video . <p> I could make this blog/post VERY long as I can get carried away ! ! ! So , I 'll end it here . If you would like homework , go through the list above and see what things you would like to start with . Get what you need ! <p> -seeds <p> -pots <p> -good starting seed-soil <p> Next week , I am going to talk about bumping up your plants . It 's night quite as fun as bumper cars ! !

@@84931441 <h> FDA Worries COVID-19 Test Misses Too Many People Who Are Infected <p> The Food And Drug Administration is raising concerns about the accuracy of the Abbott ID Now Coronavirus test , which returns results within 15 minutes . The FDA worries about false negative results . <p> STEVE INSKEEP , HOST : <p> Is a coronavirus test that the president promoted reliable ? The Abbott ID Now test is a small machine , about the size of a toaster . And it 's fast . Within 15 minutes , it is supposed to be able to spot people infected with coronavirus . But the Food and Drug Administration has now issued an alert about the test 's accuracy . NPR health correspondent Rob Stein is covering this story . Rob , good morning . <p> ROB STEIN , BYLINE : Good morning , Steve . <p> INSKEEP : How big a deal would it be if this particular test proves not to be so good ? <p> STEIN : Well , you know , Steve , this test has gotten a lot of attention because it 's so fast . You know , President Trump has praised it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to screen people at the White House . And it 's in big demand around the country . You know , the company that makes it has distributed at least 1.8 million of the tests . And it 's cranking out 50,000 new tests every day to keep up with the demand . And we should point out that Abbott Laboratories is an NPR sponsor . <p> INSKEEP : Absolutely . But we 're reporting on their problems here just the same . What is the FDA 's concern about the test ? <p> STEIN : The FDA issued a statement last night alerting the public that research is raising questions about the reliability of the tests , that it may produce inaccurate results . Specifically , the FDA is concerned about false negative results , meaning the test may tell people that they are negative when they 're really positive . In other words , the test may miss too many people who are really infected . <p> INSKEEP : Why does the FDA have that concern ? <p> STEIN : You know , the FDA is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPR reported back in April that researchers at the Cleveland Clinic had found that the Abbott ID Now test appears to be significantly less reliable than several of the other widely used tests . In their study , the test missed about 15 out of every hundred infections . And another study came out just this week from researchers at New York University . They found that the test could miss between a third and half of infections . <p> INSKEEP : Wow . Well , what does the company say when confronted with a study that finds that their test might be about as accurate as a coin flip ? <p> STEIN : Yeah . So you know , Abbott is saying , no test is perfect . But it 's basically standing by the ID Now . The company says the problem is with the studies , not the test . The way the specimens used in the studies were collected , handled , you know , stored and transported could have caused the problems . For example , the samples that were tested in the Cleveland Clinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly into the testing machine like the company says they 're supposed to . That would have diluted the specimens . And the company says other studies found the Abbott test to be just as accurate as any other test . <p> INSKEEP : OK . So they are questioning the tests of their test . But the FDA ... <p> STEIN : Yeah . <p> INSKEEP : ... Has done this advisory . Does this mean we should n't be relying on the test at all ? <p> STEIN : No , no . The FDA is not saying that . The FDA says the test can still be used . It can correctly identify many positive cases . But the FDA is saying that negative results may need to be confirmed with one of the other tests that have been shown to be highly reliable . And both Abbott and the FDA say they 're working together to take a look at the test more closely . <p> INSKEEP : What are outside experts saying , Rob ? <p> STEIN : I talked to Michael Mina about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he says the fast tests like the Abbott ID Now can definitely be useful as long as you realize that the speed may come with some tradeoffs . But he worries about relying on it to try to stop new outbreaks . <p> MICHAEL MINA : If you 're really trying to prevent an outbreak from occurring , you know , one missed case can become a whole new transmission chain onward . <p> STEIN : You know , he also worries about the White House relying on this test .
